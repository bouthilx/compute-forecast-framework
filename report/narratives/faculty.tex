\section{Empowering Research Excellence: A Vision for Faculty}

\subsection{Current Reality: Excellence Despite Constraints}

Our faculty consistently demonstrate world-class research capabilities, yet face computational limitations that increasingly constrain their potential:

\subsubsection{Infrastructure Limitations}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Model Scale}: Limited to models under 10B parameters while peers work with 175B+ parameter models
\item \textbf{Training Duration}: Maximum 2-week runs versus 3-6 months at leading institutions
\item \textbf{Queue Times}: 4-8 week waits for large-scale experiments, disrupting research momentum
\item \textbf{Exploration Constraints}: Unable to pursue high-risk, high-reward research requiring substantial compute
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Competitive Disadvantages}
\begin{itemize}
\item Difficulty attracting top graduate students who need computational resources for thesis work
\item Reduced competitiveness for prestigious grants requiring infrastructure demonstration
\item Limited ability to collaborate on large-scale international projects
\item Pressure to pursue incremental rather than transformative research
\end{itemize}
