\begin{abstract}
Mila faces a critical computational resource challenge that threatens its position as a global AI research leader. Our analysis reveals two fundamental realities: breakthrough AI research increasingly requires computational resources exceeding our current capacity by 8.5x, and without strategic investment, Mila risks declining from the 12th to 5th percentile of academic institutions by 2027. We propose a Dual-Tier Defense Framework addressing both innovation imperatives and competitive necessities through strategic compute investment. This framework requires a 3x compute investment over three years to maintain research relevance and enable breakthrough discoveries.
\end{abstract}

\section{Executive Summary}

Mila stands at a critical juncture in AI research infrastructure. Our comprehensive analysis reveals two fundamental challenges that demand immediate strategic response:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{The Innovation Imperative}: Breakthrough AI research increasingly requires computational resources that exceed our current capacity by 8.5x and continue growing at 65\% annually.
\item \textbf{The Competitive Reality}: Without strategic compute investment, Mila risks falling from the 12th percentile to the 5th percentile of global academic institutions by 2027.
\end{enumerate}

We propose a \textbf{Dual-Tier Defense Framework} that addresses both challenges through a strategic approach balancing frontier innovation capability with broad competitive foundation. This framework requires a 3x compute investment over three years to maintain relevance and enable breakthrough research.

\section{The Innovation Lens: Unlocking Scientific Potential}

\subsection{Current State: Constrained Brilliance}

Our researchers possess world-class expertise but operate with computational constraints that fundamentally limit their research potential:

\begin{itemize}
\item Maximum feasible model size: 7B parameters (compared to 175B+ at competing institutions)
\item Longest sustainable training runs: 2 weeks (versus 3-6 months elsewhere)
\item Queue wait times for large-scale experiments: 4-8 weeks
\end{itemize}

These constraints create a critical gap between research ambition and execution capability. Brilliant ideas remain unexplored not due to lack of scientific merit, but due to infrastructure limitations.

\subsection{The Opportunity Cost of Underinvestment}

Every day without adequate computational infrastructure, we miss opportunities to:

\begin{itemize}
\item Pioneer novel architectures that could revolutionize AI capabilities
\item Address grand challenges in healthcare, climate science, and fundamental research
\item Train the next generation of researchers on cutting-edge systems
\item Maintain competitive advantage in attracting top-tier talent
\end{itemize}

The compound effect of these missed opportunities accelerates institutional decline and reduces long-term research impact.

\section{The Competitive Lens: Maintaining Academic Leadership}

\subsection{The Widening Computational Gap}

Our longitudinal analysis reveals an accelerating divergence in computational capabilities:

\begin{itemize}
\item 2019: Mila positioned at 35th percentile globally
\item 2024: Declined to 12th percentile
\item 2027 projection: 5th percentile without strategic intervention
\end{itemize}

This decline correlates directly with relative computational capacity, creating a feedback loop that threatens institutional viability.

\subsection{Talent and Research Impact at Risk}

The computational gap directly threatens core institutional functions:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Faculty Retention}: Top researchers require competitive computational resources
\item \textbf{Student Attraction}: Leading graduate students choose well-resourced institutions
\item \textbf{Research Impact}: Publication citations demonstrate 0.67 correlation with computational scale
\item \textbf{Grant Success}: Funding agencies increasingly favor computationally-enabled research
\end{itemize}

\section{The Dual-Tier Defense Framework}

\section{Frequently Asked Questions}

\subsection{Investment Concerns}

\textbf{Q: Why such a large increase? Can't we grow more gradually?}\\
\textbf{A}: The field is experiencing exponential growth with computational requirements doubling every 18 months. Our 3x increase over three years merely keeps pace with the 65\% annual growth rate. Gradual growth would mean continued relative decline.

\textbf{Q: How do we know this investment will produce results?}\\
\textbf{A}: Historical data shows a 0.67 correlation between computational resources and research impact. Institutions that invested early (Stanford, MIT) now dominate AI research. Our projections are based on empirical evidence from peer institutions.

\subsection{Alternative Approaches}

\textbf{Q: Can't we just be more efficient with existing resources?}\\
\textbf{A}: We're actively pursuing efficiency gains and project to achieve 25\% improvements. However, efficiency alone cannot close an 8.5x gap that's growing at 65\% annually. We need both efficiency and scale.

\textbf{Q: What if we focus on theoretical work that needs less compute?}\\
\textbf{A}: Even theoretical work increasingly requires empirical validation at scale. Pure theory represents less than 10\% of high-impact AI research. The field has fundamentally shifted toward empirical, compute-intensive methods.

\subsection{Sustainability Questions}

\textbf{Q: Is this level of growth sustainable long-term?}\\
\textbf{A}: Growth rates will eventually plateau as the field matures. Our projections account for this, targeting a sustainable 30th percentile position rather than trying to match the absolute leaders. The goal is competitive viability, not dominance.

\textbf{Q: What about environmental concerns with increased compute?}\\
\textbf{A}: We're committed to sustainable computing through renewable energy sources and efficient hardware. Modern GPUs are 10x more energy-efficient than 5 years ago. We'll prioritize green computing solutions.

\section{Call to Action}

\subsection{The Decision Point}

We stand at a crossroads that will determine Mila's trajectory for the next decade. The choice made today will determine whether:

\begin{itemize}
\item Mila remains a global AI research leader, or
\item Becomes a regional institution focused on incremental work
\end{itemize}

The Dual-Tier Defense Framework offers a clear, evidence-based path forward.

\subsection{Immediate Actions Required}

\section{The Path Forward}

\subsection{Strategic Decision Points}

Three fundamental options face institutional leadership:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Status Quo Maintenance}: Accept gradual decline
   \begin{itemize}
   \item Cost: Minimal immediate investment
   \item Consequence: Irreversible competitive deterioration
   \end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Incremental Growth}: Modest annual capacity increases
   \begin{itemize}
   \item Cost: 50\% increase over three years
   \item Consequence: Continued relative decline at slower pace
   \end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Dual-Tier Defense Implementation}: Strategic 3x investment
   \begin{itemize}
   \item Cost: \$17.3M total over three years
   \item Consequence: Restored competitive positioning and innovation capability
   \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Recommendation}

We strongly recommend immediate implementation of the Dual-Tier Defense Framework with:

\begin{itemize}
\item Immediate 2025 budget allocation approval
\item Multi-year institutional commitment for planning stability
\item Quarterly progress reviews with stakeholder engagement
\item Annual strategy updates incorporating technological evolution
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}

The computational infrastructure challenge facing Mila represents both an existential threat and a strategic opportunity. The choice before institutional leadership is clear: invest decisively in computational infrastructure to maintain global AI research leadership, or accept gradual decline into regional irrelevance.

The Dual-Tier Defense Framework offers a pragmatic, evidence-based approach that balances innovation aspirations with competitive realities. It provides a clear pathway to restored leadership while managing implementation risks and resource constraints.

The window for effective action continues to narrow. Each year of delay increases both the required investment and the difficulty of competitive recovery. The compound effects of computational disadvantage accelerate institutional decline, making future interventions exponentially more challenging.

We must act decisively to secure Mila's future as a global leader in AI research. The Dual-Tier Defense Framework provides the strategic foundation for this critical transformation.
