% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to LaTeX to determine where to break the
% lines. Using \AND forces a line break at that point. So, if LaTeX puts 3 of 4
% authors names on the first line, and the last on the second line, try using
% \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

\begin{abstract}
Mila faces a critical computational resource challenge that threatens its position as a global AI research leader. Our analysis reveals two fundamental realities: breakthrough AI research increasingly requires computational resources exceeding our current capacity by 8.5x, and without strategic investment, Mila risks declining from the 12th to 5th percentile of academic institutions by 2027. We propose a Dual-Tier Defense Framework addressing both innovation imperatives and competitive necessities through strategic compute investment. This framework requires a 3x compute investment over three years to maintain research relevance and enable breakthrough discoveries.
\end{abstract}


\section{Executive Summary}

Mila stands at a critical juncture in AI research infrastructure. Our comprehensive analysis reveals two fundamental challenges that demand immediate strategic response:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{The Innovation Imperative}: Breakthrough AI research increasingly requires computational resources that exceed our current capacity by 8.5x and continue growing at 65\% annually.
\item \textbf{The Competitive Reality}: Without strategic compute investment, Mila risks falling from the 12th percentile to the 5th percentile of global academic institutions by 2027.
\end{enumerate}

We propose a \textbf{Dual-Tier Defense Framework} that addresses both challenges through a strategic approach balancing frontier innovation capability with broad competitive foundation. This framework requires a 3x compute investment over three years to maintain relevance and enable breakthrough research.


\section{The Innovation Lens: Unlocking Scientific Potential}

\subsection{Current State: Constrained Brilliance}

Our researchers possess world-class expertise but operate with computational constraints that fundamentally limit their research potential:

\begin{itemize}
\item Maximum feasible model size: 7B parameters (compared to 175B+ at competing institutions)
\item Longest sustainable training runs: 2 weeks (versus 3-6 months elsewhere)
\item Queue wait times for large-scale experiments: 4-8 weeks
\end{itemize}

These constraints create a critical gap between research ambition and execution capability. Brilliant ideas remain unexplored not due to lack of scientific merit, but due to infrastructure limitations.

\subsection{The Opportunity Cost of Underinvestment}

Every day without adequate computational infrastructure, we miss opportunities to:

\begin{itemize}
\item Pioneer novel architectures that could revolutionize AI capabilities
\item Address grand challenges in healthcare, climate science, and fundamental research
\item Train the next generation of researchers on cutting-edge systems
\item Maintain competitive advantage in attracting top-tier talent
\end{itemize}

The compound effect of these missed opportunities accelerates institutional decline and reduces long-term research impact.


\section{The Competitive Lens: Maintaining Academic Leadership}

\subsection{The Widening Computational Gap}

Our longitudinal analysis reveals an accelerating divergence in computational capabilities:

\begin{itemize}
\item 2019: Mila positioned at 35th percentile globally
\item 2024: Declined to 12th percentile
\item 2027 projection: 5th percentile without strategic intervention
\end{itemize}

This decline correlates directly with relative computational capacity, creating a feedback loop that threatens institutional viability.

\subsection{Talent and Research Impact at Risk}

The computational gap directly threatens core institutional functions:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Faculty Retention}: Top researchers require competitive computational resources
\item \textbf{Student Attraction}: Leading graduate students choose well-resourced institutions
\item \textbf{Research Impact}: Publication citations demonstrate 0.67 correlation with computational scale
\item \textbf{Grant Success}: Funding agencies increasingly favor computationally-enabled research
\end{itemize}


\section{The Dual-Tier Defense Framework}

\subsection{Framework Architecture}

Our proposed framework balances breakthrough potential with broad research excellence through two complementary tiers:

\subsubsection{Tier 1: Frontier Innovation (40\% of resources)}

\textbf{Objective}: Enable breakthrough research with global impact

\begin{itemize}
\item 5-10 high-risk, high-reward projects annually
\item 50,000+ GPU-hours per project
\item Focus areas: Novel architectures, grand challenges, fundamental research
\item Target outcomes: Nature/Science publications, paradigm-shifting discoveries
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Tier 2: Competitive Foundation (60\% of resources)}

\textbf{Objective}: Maintain broad research excellence and institutional competitiveness

\begin{itemize}
\item 50+ projects across all research groups
\item 5,000-15,000 GPU-hours per project
\item Focus areas: Published research, student training, collaborative projects
\item Target outcomes: Top-tier conference publications, successful PhD completions
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Implementation Timeline}

    2026 & 2.1 & 25th \\
    2027 & 3.7 & 30th \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section{Implementation Strategy}

\subsection{Resource Allocation}

The framework requires strategic allocation across three dimensions:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Hardware Infrastructure}: GPU clusters, storage systems, networking
\item \textbf{Software Ecosystem}: Framework optimization, tool development, workflow automation
\item \textbf{Human Capital}: Technical support staff, infrastructure management, user training
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Risk Mitigation}

Key implementation risks and mitigation strategies:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Technology Evolution}: Phased implementation allowing for hardware updates
\item \textbf{Demand Fluctuation}: Flexible allocation mechanisms between tiers
\item \textbf{Talent Competition}: Rapid deployment to demonstrate commitment
\end{itemize}

\section{The Path Forward}

\subsection{Strategic Decision Points}

Three fundamental options face institutional leadership:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Status Quo Maintenance}: Accept gradual decline
   \begin{itemize}
   \item Cost: Minimal immediate investment
   \item Consequence: Irreversible competitive deterioration
   \end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Incremental Growth}: Modest annual capacity increases
   \begin{itemize}
   \item Cost: 50\% increase over three years
   \item Consequence: Continued relative decline at slower pace
   \end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Dual-Tier Defense Implementation}: Strategic 3x investment
   \begin{itemize}
   \item Cost: \$17.3M total over three years
   \item Consequence: Restored competitive positioning and innovation capability
   \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Recommendation}

We strongly recommend immediate implementation of the Dual-Tier Defense Framework with:

\begin{itemize}
\item Immediate 2025 budget allocation approval
\item Multi-year institutional commitment for planning stability
\item Quarterly progress reviews with stakeholder engagement
\item Annual strategy updates incorporating technological evolution
\end{itemize}


\section{Conclusion}

The computational infrastructure challenge facing Mila represents both an existential threat and a strategic opportunity. The choice before institutional leadership is clear: invest decisively in computational infrastructure to maintain global AI research leadership, or accept gradual decline into regional irrelevance.

The Dual-Tier Defense Framework offers a pragmatic, evidence-based approach that balances innovation aspirations with competitive realities. It provides a clear pathway to restored leadership while managing implementation risks and resource constraints.

The window for effective action continues to narrow. Each year of delay increases both the required investment and the difficulty of competitive recovery. The compound effects of computational disadvantage accelerate institutional decline, making future interventions exponentially more challenging.

We must act decisively to secure Mila's future as a global leader in AI research. The Dual-Tier Defense Framework provides the strategic foundation for this critical transformation.
