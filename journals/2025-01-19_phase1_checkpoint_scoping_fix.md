# 2025-01-19 Fixed Phase 1 Checkpoint Scoping Issue

## Problem
The user reported a `NameError` when running the consolidation command with the new checkpoint implementation:
```
NameError: cannot access free variable 'identifiers' where it is not associated with a value in enclosing scope
```

The error occurred in the `phase1_checkpoint` callback function which was trying to access the `identifiers` variable that wasn't in its scope.

## Root Cause
The `harvest_identifiers_openalex` function was calling `checkpoint_callback()` without any parameters, but the `phase1_checkpoint` function defined in the main consolidate function was expecting to access `identifiers` from its enclosing scope. This created a closure variable access issue.

## Solution
Modified the code to pass `identifiers` as a parameter:

1. Updated `harvest_identifiers_openalex` to call `checkpoint_callback(identifiers)` instead of `checkpoint_callback()`
2. Updated the `phase1_checkpoint` function to accept `current_identifiers` as a parameter
3. Updated the docstring to document that the checkpoint callback expects identifiers as a parameter

## Code Changes

In `compute_forecast/cli/commands/consolidate.py`:

1. Line 235: Changed `checkpoint_callback()` to `checkpoint_callback(identifiers)`
2. Line 622: Function already correctly defined as `def phase1_checkpoint(current_identifiers):`
3. Updated docstring for `harvest_identifiers_openalex` to clarify the checkpoint callback signature

## Testing Status
The scoping issue has been resolved. The checkpoint callback now properly receives the identifiers dictionary and can save the checkpoint with the current state.

## Summary
This was a simple parameter passing issue where the callback wasn't receiving the data it needed. The fix ensures that the checkpoint system can properly save the collected identifiers at each batch boundary during Phase 1 of the consolidation process.
