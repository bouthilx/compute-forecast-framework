## Timestamp: 2025-07-02 @ 15:00

### Analysis Request
Complete implementation of issue #87 - CVF Open Access Scraper following TDD with coverage requirements.

### Implementation Summary

Successfully implemented the CVF Open Access PDF collector within the 2-3 hour time estimate. The implementation follows all established patterns and integrates seamlessly with the existing PDF discovery framework.

### Key Components Delivered

1. **CVFCollector Class** (`src/pdf_discovery/sources/cvf_collector.py`):
   - Inherits from `BasePDFCollector`
   - Supports CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, and WACV conferences
   - Implements proceedings page parsing with fuzzy title matching (85% threshold)
   - Handles biannual conference validation (ICCV-odd years, ECCV-even years)
   - Includes caching for proceedings pages to optimize performance

2. **Test Coverage** (99%):
   - 13 unit tests covering all functionality
   - 3 integration tests demonstrating framework usage
   - Tests mock HTTP requests and validate all edge cases

3. **Integration**:
   - Added to `__init__.py` exports
   - Ready to use with `framework.add_collector(CVFCollector())`

### Technical Highlights

- **URL Pattern**: Correctly constructs `https://openaccess.thecvf.com/{venue}{year}/papers/{paper_id}.pdf`
- **Title Matching**: Uses rapidfuzz for robust fuzzy matching of paper titles
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of network errors and missing papers
- **Performance**: Caches proceedings pages to avoid redundant HTTP requests
