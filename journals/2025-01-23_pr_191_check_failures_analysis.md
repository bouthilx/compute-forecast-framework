## Updates

### 2025-01-23 - Initial Analysis
- Identified all failing checks from PR #191
- Created comprehensive list of issues
- Set up tracking for fixes

### 2025-01-23 - Progress Update 1
**Completed**:
- Fixed bare except in download_orchestrator.py:387 (changed to `except queue.Empty`)
- Fixed trailing whitespace in 7 files using sed
- Added final newlines to 8 journal files
- Ran ruff formatter on all files (5 files reformatted)

**In Progress**:
- Fixed integration test failures related to mocking - needed to patch PDFDownloader._create_session instead of requests.Session.get
- Fixed missing import of queue module that was causing thread exceptions
- test_download_with_failures now passes
- Working on test_resume_functionality - issue with storage check causing re-download of "completed" files

**Fixed Issues**:
- Mock PDF content was too small (< 1KB), causing validation failures
- PDFDownloader creates its own session, so patching needed to be at the right level
- Queue-based processing was failing due to missing import

### 2025-01-23 - Progress Update 2
**StorageManager Unit Test Issues**:
Found extensive API mismatches in storage manager tests:
- Tests use `pdf_path` parameter but method expects `source_path`
- Tests expect tuple returns `(success, error)` but `save_pdf` returns only bool
- Tests reference `storage_manager.cache_dir` but should use `storage_manager.local_cache.cache_dir`
- Tests call `get_pdf()` but method is `get_pdf_path()`
- Tests expect `location == "google_drive"` but API returns `"drive"`

**Partially Fixed**:
- Updated mock setup for drive-only storage manager to properly mock local cache
- Fixed some method names and parameters
- Fixed expected location string from "google_drive" to "drive"

**Still Need to Fix**:
- 13 out of 15 storage manager tests still failing
- Need systematic fix for all API mismatches

### Progress Update

Successfully fixed:
1. ✅ PR title (added "feat:" prefix)
2. ✅ Bare except clause (changed to `except queue.Empty`)
3. ✅ Missing import of `queue` module
4. ✅ All trailing whitespace issues
5. ✅ All missing final newlines
6. ✅ Unused imports in monitoring and storage modules
7. ✅ Integration test mocking approach (patching PDFDownloader._create_session)
8. ✅ StorageManager unit test API mismatches
9. ✅ Download orchestrator session counter tracking (fixed to return session counts instead of total counts)

Currently working on:
- Integration test failures (test_resume_functionality has a complex race condition issue)

### Technical Issues Found

#### test_resume_functionality Race Condition
The test expects "Successful: 1" but gets "Successful: 0". Investigation shows:
- The download is attempted (mock is called once)
- The issue is with session counter tracking in concurrent execution
- Messages are sent to a queue and processed asynchronously
- There's a race condition where the download completes but the message isn't processed before counts are returned
- Added a wait for queue to empty before stopping processor thread, but issue persists
- This may require a more fundamental fix to ensure proper synchronization

### Final Status Summary

**Pre-commit Fixes (All Completed)**:
- ✅ Fixed trailing whitespace in 7 files
- ✅ Added final newlines to 8 files
- ✅ Fixed bare except in download_orchestrator.py:387
- ✅ Ran ruff format on 5 files
- ✅ Updated PR title with conventional commit prefix

**Test Fixes Completed**:
- ✅ Fixed unused imports causing pre-commit failures
- ✅ Fixed StorageManager unit test API mismatches (all 15 tests passing)
- ✅ Fixed integration test mocking approach
- ✅ Fixed test_retry_failed_with_permanent_failures (PDF size issue)
- ✅ Fixed test_failed_papers_export_format (file cleanup issue)
- ✅ Fixed memory leak test (was already passing)

**All Issues Resolved!** ✅

The race condition was actually caused by a missing line of code - the session counter increment was missing from the DOWNLOAD_COMPLETE message handler. After adding `self._session_successful += 1` back to the handler, all integration tests now pass.

The delay added after queue emptying helps ensure all messages are fully processed before returning counts.

### Final Fix for StorageManager Tests
After pre-commit/linting fixes, some StorageManager tests failed due to:
1. Tests using `upload_file` instead of `upload_with_progress`
2. Tests expecting exceptions but API returns None on failure
3. Mock download paths not being relative to cache directory
4. Tests checking wrong mock method calls

**Fixes Applied**:
- Changed all `upload_file` references to `upload_with_progress`
- Changed mock side_effect exceptions to return_value = None
- Fixed mock download paths to be within cache directory
- Fixed test assertions to match actual API behavior
- Used side_effect callbacks to create files during mock download

**Result**: All 15 StorageManager tests now pass! ✅
