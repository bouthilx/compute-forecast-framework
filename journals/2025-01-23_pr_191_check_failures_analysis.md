## Updates

### 2025-01-23 - Initial Analysis
- Identified all failing checks from PR #191
- Created comprehensive list of issues
- Set up tracking for fixes

### 2025-01-23 - Progress Update 1
**Completed**:
- Fixed bare except in download_orchestrator.py:387 (changed to `except queue.Empty`)
- Fixed trailing whitespace in 7 files using sed
- Added final newlines to 8 journal files
- Ran ruff formatter on all files (5 files reformatted)

**In Progress**:
- Fixed integration test failures related to mocking - needed to patch PDFDownloader._create_session instead of requests.Session.get
- Fixed missing import of queue module that was causing thread exceptions
- test_download_with_failures now passes
- Working on test_resume_functionality - issue with storage check causing re-download of "completed" files

**Fixed Issues**:
- Mock PDF content was too small (< 1KB), causing validation failures
- PDFDownloader creates its own session, so patching needed to be at the right level
- Queue-based processing was failing due to missing import

### 2025-01-23 - Progress Update 2
**StorageManager Unit Test Issues**:
Found extensive API mismatches in storage manager tests:
- Tests use `pdf_path` parameter but method expects `source_path`
- Tests expect tuple returns `(success, error)` but `save_pdf` returns only bool
- Tests reference `storage_manager.cache_dir` but should use `storage_manager.local_cache.cache_dir`
- Tests call `get_pdf()` but method is `get_pdf_path()`
- Tests expect `location == "google_drive"` but API returns `"drive"`

**Partially Fixed**:
- Updated mock setup for drive-only storage manager to properly mock local cache
- Fixed some method names and parameters
- Fixed expected location string from "google_drive" to "drive"

**Still Need to Fix**:
- 13 out of 15 storage manager tests still failing
- Need systematic fix for all API mismatches
