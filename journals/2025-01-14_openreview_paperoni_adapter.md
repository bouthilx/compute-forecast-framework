# OpenReview Paperoni-Inspired Adapter Implementation Journal

## 2025-01-14 14:00 - Analysis and Planning

### Context
The user requested implementation of a new OpenReview adapter that properly leverages paperoni's sophisticated decision extraction logic while avoiding its complex model system and database dependencies. The goal is to create a more reliable scraper that filters out rejected papers correctly.

### Analysis Requested
1. Understand how paperoni extracts decisions from OpenReview papers
2. Implement decision extraction in our adapter
3. Create a new adapter inspired by paperoni without its complexity

### How I Proceeded

#### 1. Analysis of Paperoni's OpenReview Scraper
I examined `paperoni/src/paperoni/sources/scrapers/openreview.py` and discovered:

**Key Findings:**
- **Sophisticated decision extraction**: The `figure_out_the_fking_decision` method (lines 120-182) uses a priority-based heuristic system
- **Multiple fallback mechanisms**: Searches replies → venue field → venueid → publication date → bibtex
- **Pattern refinement**: Maps various text patterns to standardized decisions (e.g., "submitted" → "rejected")
- **API version handling**: Uses v1 for older conferences, v2 for newer ones
- **Smart filtering**: Different strategies based on venue and year

**Decision Extraction Heuristics (by priority):**
1. Rank 5: Withdrawn papers (highest priority)
2. Rank 10-20: Decision invitations
3. Rank 30-40: Accept/general decision fields
4. Rank 50: Meta-review recommendations (lowest priority)

#### 2. Current Adapter Issues
Reviewed our current OpenReview adapter and found:
- Makes direct API calls instead of using paperoni scrapers
- Basic decision extraction that misses edge cases
- Doesn't properly filter rejected papers in all scenarios
- Inconsistent handling of API v1 vs v2 differences

#### 3. Design Decision
After evaluating options, decided to create a paperoni-inspired implementation rather than directly integrating paperoni because:
- Avoids complex paperoni models (Paper, Author, Institution, etc.)
- No database dependencies
- Simpler to maintain and debug
- Can cherry-pick the best parts of paperoni's logic

### Detailed Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure Setup
**Goal**: Establish the foundation with dual API support and basic structure

1. **Create new file**: `openreview_v2.py` alongside existing adapter
2. **Dual API client setup**:
   ```python
   - Initialize both v1 and v2 clients in __init__
   - Implement _get_api_client(year) for automatic selection
   - Add _should_use_v1(venue, year) logic
   ```
3. **Venue ID management**:
   ```python
   - Port _get_venue_id() with year-based patterns
   - Add _venues_from_wildcard() for pattern matching
   - Map our venue names to OpenReview format
   ```

#### Phase 2: Smart Decision Extraction (Paperoni-Inspired)
**Goal**: Implement sophisticated decision extraction with multiple fallbacks

1. **Core decision extraction method**:
   ```python
   def _extract_decision_smart(self, submission, venue_lower, year):
       # 1. Check cached decisions (for v1 batch processing)
       # 2. Apply heuristics to replies (ranked by priority)
       # 3. Fallback to venue field
       # 4. Fallback to venueid
       # 5. Check publication date
       # 6. Last resort: bibtex
   ```

2. **Heuristics implementation**:
   ```python
   - Port the ranked heuristics list
   - Implement _search_replies_for_decision()
   - Handle both v1 (single invitation) and v2 (invitations list)
   ```

3. **Decision refinement**:
   ```python
   - Port _refine_decision() pattern matching
   - Ensure "submitted" → "rejected" mapping
   - Normalize decision strings
   ```

#### Phase 3: Optimized Query Strategies
**Goal**: Implement year and venue-specific query optimizations

1. **ICLR 2024+ optimization**:
   ```python
   def _get_accepted_by_venueid(self, venue_id):
       # Use venueid field to get only accepted papers
       # Much more efficient than filtering all submissions
   ```

2. **ICLR 2023 and earlier**:
   ```python
   def _get_conference_submissions_v1(self, venue_id, year):
       # Fetch all submissions
       # Batch process decisions for efficiency
       # Cache decisions in submission objects
   ```

3. **Other venues (TMLR, COLM, RLC)**:
   ```python
   - Implement venue-specific logic
   - Handle continuous publication (TMLR)
   - Adapt invitation patterns per venue
   ```

#### Phase 4: Streamlined Data Conversion
**Goal**: Efficient conversion from OpenReview to SimplePaper format

1. **Field extraction utilities**:
   ```python
   def _extract_field(self, content, field_name):
       # Handle v1 (direct values) vs v2 (dict with 'value')
       # Graceful handling of missing fields
   ```

2. **Paper conversion**:
   ```python
   def _convert_to_simple_paper(self, submission, decision, venue, year):
       # Direct conversion without intermediate models
       # Map decisions to our acceptance types
       # Extract all required fields
   ```

3. **Decision classification**:
   ```python
   def _classify_decision(self, decision):
       # Map paperoni decisions to our types
       # Handle: oral, poster, spotlight, notable
       # Default accepted to poster
   ```

#### Phase 5: Error Handling and Robustness
**Goal**: Make the adapter production-ready

1. **Retry mechanisms**:
   - Leverage OpenReview client's built-in retries
   - Add exponential backoff for rate limiting
   - Log retry attempts

2. **Graceful degradation**:
   - Continue processing even if some papers fail
   - Collect and report errors at the end
   - Never fail the entire batch for one bad paper

3. **Comprehensive logging**:
   - Log decision extraction process
   - Track filtering statistics
   - Debug mode for detailed traces

### Implementation Order

1. **Start with core structure** - Create the class with basic methods
2. **Port decision extraction** - This is the most critical improvement
3. **Implement basic querying** - Get papers from venues
4. **Add optimizations** - Year-specific strategies
5. **Polish and test** - Error handling, logging, edge cases

### Success Metrics

1. **Correctly filters ALL rejected papers** (currently some slip through)
2. **Properly classifies acceptance types** (oral, poster, spotlight, notable)
3. **Handles both API versions** transparently
4. **Maintains or improves performance** vs current adapter
5. **No external dependencies** beyond openreview-py

### Risk Mitigation

1. **Keep existing adapter** - New implementation as v2
2. **Extensive testing** - Multiple venues and years
3. **Gradual rollout** - Test with small batches first
4. **Fallback ready** - Can revert to old adapter if issues

### Next Steps

Begin implementation starting with Phase 1, creating the basic structure and dual API setup.

   - New: Multi-level fallback system with ranked heuristics

2. **Proper Rejection Filtering**
   - Original: Some rejected papers slipped through
   - New: Comprehensive filtering including "submitted" papers

3. **Optimized Queries**

### Usage

The new adapter can be used as a drop-in replacement:

```python
from compute_forecast.pipeline.metadata_collection.sources.scrapers.paperoni_adapters import OpenReviewAdapterV2

adapter = OpenReviewAdapterV2()
papers = adapter.scrape_venue_year("ICLR", 2024)
```

### Next Steps

1. **Testing**: Need to test with various venues and years
2. **Migration**: Gradually migrate from old adapter to new one
3. **Monitoring**: Track performance and accuracy improvements

### Technical Debt Addressed
