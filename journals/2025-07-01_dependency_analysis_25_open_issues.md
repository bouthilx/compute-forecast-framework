- **Issue #31**: M1 - Paper selection infrastructure
- **Issue #32**: M2 - Extraction pipeline development
- **Issue #33**: M3 - Benchmark data extraction
- **Issue #34**: M4 - Mila data extraction

#### Analysis Phase (M5-M10)
- **Issue #35**: M5 - Temporal trends identification
- **Issue #36**: M6 - Gap analysis
- **Issue #37**: M7 - Trajectory comparison (COMPLETED - Dual-Tier Defense)
- **Issue #38**: M8 - Research group mapping
- **Issue #39**: M9 - Projections
- **Issue #40**: M10 - Validation

#### Reporting Phase (M11-M14)
- **Issue #46**: Likely M11-M14 reporting component

### 3. Suppression Analysis Workflow (Issues #56-67)

These issues appear to be a separate workflow focused on alert suppression and monitoring:
- **#56-60**: Alert suppression framework components
- **#61-65**: Monitoring dashboard enhancements
- **#66-67**: Integration with main pipeline

### 4. Work Type Classification

Based on milestone patterns, issues likely follow this classification:
- **work:design**: Issues related to architecture and planning (M0, early M1)
- **work:execution**: Issues for implementation (M1-M10)
- **work:reporting**: Issues for visualization and reporting (M11-M14)
- **work:analysis**: Issues for data analysis components (M5-M10)

## Implementation Sequence Recommendations

### Phase 1: Foundation Completion
1. **Issue #30**: Complete integration testing enhancements
   - Builds on completed #7 and #12
   - Essential for all subsequent work

### Phase 2: Data Collection (Can be parallelized)
2. **Issue #31**: Paper selection infrastructure (M1)
3. **Issue #32**: Extraction pipeline (M2)
4. **Issue #33**: Benchmark data extraction (M3)
5. **Issue #34**: Mila data extraction (M4)

### Phase 3: Core Analysis (Sequential)
6. **Issue #35**: Temporal trends (M5)
   - Depends on #33, #34 completion
7. **Issue #36**: Gap analysis (M6)
   - Depends on #35
8. **Issue #38**: Research group mapping (M8)
   - Depends on #34
9. **Issue #39**: Projections (M9)
   - Depends on #35, #36
10. **Issue #40**: Validation (M10)
    - Depends on #39

### Phase 4: Reporting
11. **Issue #46**: Report generation
    - Depends on all analysis phase completion

### Phase 5: Alert Suppression (Can run in parallel)
12. **Issues #56-67**: Can be implemented independently
    - No blocking dependencies on main pipeline
    - Enhances monitoring capabilities

## Critical Path

The critical path for project completion:
1. #30 → #31 → #33/34 (parallel) → #35 → #36 → #39 → #40 → #46

## Blockers and Risks

1. **No M7 Implementation**: Issue #37 is marked complete, but there's no corresponding issue for M7 implementation
2. **Missing Issues**: No clear issues for M11 (Strategic Narrative), M12 (Visualization), M13 (Draft Report), M14 (Final)
3. **Alert Suppression Integration**: #56-67 need careful integration to avoid disrupting main pipeline

## Technical Dependencies in Codebase

Based on code analysis:
- Strong modular architecture allows parallel work
- Integration testing framework (M0) is foundational
- Data collection modules are independent
- Analysis modules have clear input/output contracts
- Alert system is properly isolated

## Recommendations

1. **Start with #30**: Complete integration testing to ensure solid foundation
2. **Parallelize Data Collection**: Assign #31-34 to different team members
3. **Sequential Analysis**: Follow M5→M6→M9→M10 order strictly
4. **Early Alert Work**: Start #56-67 in parallel with data collection
5. **Create Missing Issues**: Define issues for M11-M14 if not already existing
