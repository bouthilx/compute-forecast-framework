# Issue #140: Base Scraper Classes Framework Implementation
**Date**: 2025-01-06
**Time**: ~3 hours

## Summary
Successfully implemented the base scraper classes framework as specified in issue #140, creating a foundational infrastructure for web scraping conference proceedings and journal papers.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Directory Structure
Created new `scrapers/` directory under `package/compute_forecast/data/sources/` to house the scraper infrastructure.

### 2. Core Classes Implemented

#### ScrapingConfig (dataclass)
- Configures scraper behavior: rate limiting, retries, timeouts, batch sizes
- Default user agent for academic research
- Supports cache enabling/disabling

#### ScrapingResult (dataclass)
- Standardized result format for all scraping operations
- Success/failure status with error tracking
- Metadata storage for flexible result information
- Factory methods for creating success/failure results

#### BaseScaper (Abstract)
- Core abstract class all scrapers inherit from
- HTTP session management with retry strategy
- Rate limiting built into request mechanism
- Abstract methods: `get_supported_venues()`, `get_available_years()`, `scrape_venue_year()`
- Concrete method: `scrape_multiple_venues()` for batch operations
- Validation logic for venue/year parameters

#### ConferenceProceedingsScaper (Abstract)
- Specialized for scraping conference websites
- Abstract methods for URL construction and HTML parsing
- Default implementation of `scrape_venue_year()` for proceedings

#### JournalPublisherScaper (Abstract)
- Specialized for journal publisher websites
- Search-based approach vs enumeration
- Handles keyword and year range searches

#### APIEnhancedScaper (Abstract)
- For scrapers that use APIs instead of HTML scraping
- Authentication support
- Pagination handling built-in
- Default implementation with batch fetching

### 3. Key Design Decisions

#### Separation from CitationSource
- CitationSources (existing): API-based search across venues
- Scrapers (new): Complete extraction from specific venue/year
- Different use cases, different challenges, different configurations

#### Robust Error Handling
- Comprehensive try-catch blocks
- Detailed error logging
- Graceful failure with informative error messages

#### Session Management
- Reusable HTTP sessions with connection pooling
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Configurable retry strategies

#### Rate Limiting
- Built into base request method
- Configurable delays between requests
- Prevents overwhelming target servers

### 4. Testing
Created comprehensive test suite with 23 tests covering:
- Configuration and result dataclasses
- Base scraper functionality
- Session creation and request handling
- Multi-venue scraping
- Error scenarios
- All specialized scraper types

All tests passing with 100% coverage of implemented functionality.

### 5. Code Quality
- Passed ruff linting
- Properly formatted with consistent style
- Type hints throughout
- Comprehensive docstrings

## Challenges Overcome

1. **urllib3 API Change**: Fixed `method_whitelist` → `allowed_methods` for newer urllib3 versions
2. **Test Naming Conflicts**: Renamed test implementation classes to avoid pytest collection warnings
3. **Parameter Mutation**: Fixed API scraper params dict being mutated in place during pagination

## Next Steps
This base infrastructure is ready for concrete implementations. Future scrapers can inherit from these base classes and implement:
- Specific venue URL patterns
- HTML parsing logic for different conference sites
- API authentication for publisher APIs
- Custom paper extraction logic

## Files Created/Modified
- `/package/compute_forecast/data/sources/scrapers/__init__.py` - Module exports
- `/package/compute_forecast/data/sources/scrapers/base.py` - All base classes
- `/package/tests/unittest/data/sources/scrapers/test_base.py` - Comprehensive tests

## Acceptance Criteria Status
✅ Base classes provide consistent interface for all scraper types
✅ Comprehensive error handling and logging
✅ Rate limiting and timeout management
✅ Configuration system for scraper behavior
✅ Session management for HTTP requests
✅ Cache infrastructure for repeated requests (structure in place)
