### Project Phase Analysis

Based on issue status patterns:

1. **Infrastructure Phase** (Mostly Complete):
   - Installation: 71% closed
   - Implementation: 72% closed
   - Design: 57% closed

2. **Data Processing Phase** (In Progress):
   - Collection: 50% closed
   - Extraction: 36% closed
   - Analysis: 18% closed

3. **Deliverable Phase** (Not Started):
   - Writing: 0% closed

### Difficult Categorizations

Several issues presented categorization challenges:

1. **Issue #37**: "Dual-Tier Defense Framework" - Could be Implementation, but "Framework" suggests Design
2. **Issue #24, #26**: Testing infrastructure blurs Implementation/Testing boundary
3. **Issue #44**: Organization classification could be Extraction or Analysis
4. **Issue #38, #64**: Visualizations could be Implementation or Execution
5. **Issues #63-67**: Writing about writing creates domain redundancy

### Recommendations

1. **Focus on Execution**: With 21 open Execution issues, this should be the current priority
2. **Prepare for Writing**: With 14 Writing issues pending, allocate resources for documentation phase
3. **Complete Extraction**: 7 open Extraction issues need completion before full analysis
4. **Maintain Testing**: Continue parallel testing efforts with 5 open Testing issues

### Conclusion

The compute-forecast project demonstrates a well-structured research initiative with clear phases: infrastructure building → data collection/extraction → analysis → reporting. The project is currently transitioning from infrastructure (mostly complete) to execution/analysis phase, with significant documentation work planned for the final phase.
