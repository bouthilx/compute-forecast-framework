# 2025-01-19 Parallel Consolidation Implementation

## Request
User pointed out that Phase 1 (OpenAlex ID harvesting) was ineffective - finding no DOIs or ArXiv IDs. They requested:
1. Remove Phase 1 entirely
2. Execute OpenAlex and Semantic Scholar in parallel
3. Process papers one at a time (no batching) since we're doing title searches anyway
4. Implement progress monitoring in the main process

## Implementation

### Architecture
Created a parallel processing architecture with:

1. **Base Worker Class** (`base_worker.py`)
   - Abstract base class for consolidation workers
   - Handles queue processing, error handling, and statistics
   - Processes papers one at a time (no batching)

2. **OpenAlexWorker** (`openalex_worker.py`)
   - Performs find + enrich in single API call per paper
   - Extracts all identifiers from enrichment response
   - Handles papers not found gracefully

3. **SemanticScholarWorker** (`semantic_scholar_worker.py`)
   - Similar to OpenAlexWorker
   - Attempts to find papers and enrich in one pass
   - Extracts all available identifiers

4. **MergeWorker** (`merge_worker.py`)
   - Consumes results from both source workers
   - Applies correct merge rules:
     - IDs: Only set if None
     - Records: Append to lists (citations, abstracts, URLs, identifiers)
   - Handles checkpointing

5. **ParallelConsolidator** (`consolidator.py`)
   - Orchestrates all workers
   - Monitors progress by polling worker statistics
   - Manages checkpoints and resume functionality

### Key Design Decisions

1. **One Paper at a Time**: Since we're doing title searches (no DOIs/ArXiv IDs from collection), batching doesn't help and just delays results.

2. **Progress in Main Thread**: Monitor worker statistics rather than using callbacks to avoid thread synchronization complexity.

3. **Dual Progress Bars**: Show real-time progress for both OpenAlex and Semantic Scholar sources.

4. **Proper Merge Rules**:
   - IDs only override if None (first source wins)
   - Records append with source attribution and timestamps

### CLI Integration
Added `consolidate-parallel` command with:
- Same options as original consolidate
- Support for checkpointing and resume
- Dual progress bar display
- Dry run capability

### Issues Encountered

1. **Import Paths**: Had to switch from relative to absolute imports for reliability

2. **Worker Hanging**: Initial test showed workers starting but hanging. This appears to be due to the blocking nature of the find/enrich operations with the APIs. The retry logic with connection errors may be contributing to delays.

## Next Steps

The implementation is complete but needs debugging for the hanging issue. Possible causes:
1. API timeouts without proper error handling
2. Queue blocking issues
3. Progress monitoring preventing proper shutdown

The architecture is sound and follows the plan from the journal. Once the hanging issue is resolved, this will provide efficient parallel consolidation with proper progress tracking and checkpoint support.
