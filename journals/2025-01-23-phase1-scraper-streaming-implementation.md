# 2025-01-23 - Phase 1 Implementation: Scraper Streaming Support

## Summary

Successfully implemented streaming support for all three target scrapers as part of Phase 1 of the parallel scraping implementation plan. All scrapers now support yielding papers one-by-one through the new `scrape_venue_year_iter()` method.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Base Class Enhancement

Added `scrape_venue_year_iter()` method to `BaseScraper` with a default implementation that maintains backwards compatibility:

```python
def scrape_venue_year_iter(self, venue: str, year: int) -> Iterator[SimplePaper]:
    """
    Stream papers one by one from a venue for a specific year.
    
    Default implementation uses scrape_venue_year for backwards compatibility.
    Override in subclasses for true streaming behavior.
    """
    result = self.scrape_venue_year(venue, year)
    if result.success and result.metadata.get("papers"):
        yield from result.metadata["papers"]
```

### 2. OpenReviewScraperV2 Conversion

Implemented four iterator methods for different venue/year combinations:
- `_get_tmlr_papers_iter()`: Streams TMLR papers filtering by publication year
- `_get_accepted_by_venueid_iter()`: Streams ICLR 2024+ papers using venueid query
- `_get_conference_submissions_v1_iter()`: Streams ICLR ≤2023 papers using API v1
- `_get_conference_submissions_v2_iter()`: Streams standard conference papers using API v2

Key improvements:
- Papers are yielded as they are processed, not collected in a list
- Progress logging every 100 papers for v2 iterator
- Proper iterator handling with `itertools.chain` for peeking at results

### 3. NeurIPSScraper Conversion

Converted the main paper processing loop to yield papers directly:
- Removed list accumulation in favor of yielding
- Maintained all existing functionality (PDF discovery, pattern validation)
- Progress logging every 10 papers
- No changes to PDF fetching logic

### 4. PMLRScraper Conversion

Straightforward conversion as PMLR pages are simple HTML:
- Parse all paper entries from proceedings page
- Yield papers as they are extracted
- Progress logging every 50 papers
- No changes to parsing logic

## Testing Results

Created and ran a test script that verified:
- ✅ NeurIPSScraper successfully streamed 3 papers from NeurIPS 2019
- ✅ OpenReviewScraperV2 successfully streamed 3 papers from ICLR 2024
- ✅ PMLRScraper successfully streamed 3 papers from ICML 2023
- ✅ All regular `scrape_venue_year()` methods continue to work

## Technical Notes

1. **Iterator Efficiency**: The OpenReview API already returns iterators for `get_all_notes()`, so we're leveraging that for true streaming without loading all papers into memory.

2. **Error Handling**: All iterator methods maintain the same error handling as the original methods - they log errors and continue processing rather than crashing.

3. **Rate Limiting**: Rate limiting is preserved in all streaming implementations.

4. **Client Initialization**: Fixed an issue in OpenReviewScraperV2 where clients weren't initialized before use in the iterator method.

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Memory Efficiency**: Papers are no longer accumulated in memory before being returned
2. **Real-time Progress**: Papers can be processed as soon as they are scraped
3. **Backwards Compatibility**: Existing code using `scrape_venue_year()` continues to work
4. **Foundation for Parallelism**: Streaming enables the queue-based parallel architecture

## Next Steps

With Phase 1 complete, we're ready to proceed with:
- Phase 2: Implement parallel collection infrastructure with worker processes
- Phase 3: Integration with the collect command

The streaming functionality provides the foundation needed for the parallel collection system where workers will stream papers directly to queues for real-time progress updates.
