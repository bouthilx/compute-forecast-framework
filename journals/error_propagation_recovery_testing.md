## Issue: #43 - M0-4: Error Propagation & Recovery Testing

### Summary of Work

Analyzed the existing codebase to understand the current recovery infrastructure and plan the implementation of systematic error injection and recovery validation framework.

### Findings

#### Existing Recovery Infrastructure

The codebase already has comprehensive recovery mechanisms:

1. **Interruption Recovery Engine** (`src/data/collectors/interruption_recovery.py`)
   - Handles various interruption types: API failures, process termination, network issues, component crashes, disk space exhaustion
   - Recovery strategies: checkpoint restore, partial restart, full restart, graceful degradation, component reinit
   - 5-minute recovery requirement built-in
   - State consistency validation

2. **API Health Monitor** (`src/data/collectors/api_health_monitor.py`)
   - Real-time monitoring of API health status
   - Tracks success rates, response times, consecutive errors
   - Determines health status levels: healthy, degraded, critical, offline
   - Thread-safe implementation

3. **Recovery System** (`src/orchestration/recovery_system.py`)
   - High-level orchestration of recovery operations
   - Recovery plan generation based on interruption type
   - Multiple recovery strategies with confidence scoring
   - Recovery metrics tracking

4. **State Persistence Manager** (`src/orchestration/state_persistence.py`)
   - Thread-safe session state persistence
   - Atomic writes using temporary files
   - Checkpoint validation and integrity checks

#### Existing Test Infrastructure

Found an error recovery test scenario in `src/testing/integration/test_scenarios/error_recovery.py`, but it focuses on end-to-end pipeline testing with random error injection rather than systematic component-level error injection.

### Implementation Requirements

Based on issue #43, we need to build:

1. **Systematic Error Injection Framework**
   - Register injection points in existing components
   - Support all error types: API timeout, rate limit, auth failure, network error, data corruption, memory/disk exhaustion, invalid data format, component crash
   - Controllable injection with probability settings

2. **Recovery Validation System**
   - Measure recovery time (must be within 5 minutes)
   - Validate data integrity (>95% preservation)
   - Verify graceful degradation
   - Ensure no cascading failures

3. **Component-Specific Error Handlers**
   - CollectorErrorHandler: API timeouts, rate limits, fallback behavior
   - AnalyzerErrorHandler: Corrupted input, memory pressure, partial analysis
   - ReporterErrorHandler: Output failures, permission errors

4. **Integration with Existing Systems**
   - Leverage existing InterruptionRecoveryEngine
   - Use existing StatePersistenceManager
   - Hook into APIHealthMonitor for degradation testing

### Missing Requirements

All required components exist in the codebase:
- ✅ Interruption recovery engine
- ✅ State persistence manager
- ✅ API health monitoring
- ✅ Recovery system orchestration
- ✅ Checkpoint management (referenced in imports)

The task is to build the error injection framework that systematically tests these existing recovery mechanisms.

### Implementation Plan

1. Create the file structure under `src/testing/error_injection/`
2. Implement the ErrorInjectionFramework class with injection point registration
3. Implement the RecoveryValidator class to measure recovery effectiveness
4. Create component-specific error handlers for collectors, analyzers, and reporters
5. Write comprehensive error scenarios for different failure types
6. Integrate with existing recovery systems for end-to-end testing
7. Create test suite that validates all success criteria

### Next Steps

Ready to begin implementation. All dependencies are in place. The focus will be on creating a systematic testing framework that validates the existing recovery infrastructure meets the 5-minute recovery requirement and maintains data integrity.
