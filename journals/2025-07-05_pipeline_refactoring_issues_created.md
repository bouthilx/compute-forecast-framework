# Pipeline Refactoring Issues Created

**Date**: 2025-07-05  
**Title**: Created GitHub Milestone and Issues for Pipeline Refactoring  
**Purpose**: Document the creation of milestone and issues for the pipeline refactoring project

## Summary

Successfully created a milestone and 5 sequential issues on GitHub for the pipeline refactoring project.

## Milestone Created

**Title**: Pipeline Refactoring: Paper vs PDF Collection  
**Number**: 20  
**URL**: https://github.com/bouthilx/compute-forecast/milestone/20  
**Due Date**: January 31, 2025  
**Description**: Major refactoring to clarify the distinction between paper metadata collection and PDF acquisition by creating clear pipeline stages and removing the ambiguous shared directory.

## Issues Created

### Issue #134: [Refactoring 1/5] Create Structure & Move Core Infrastructure
- **Scope**: Create new directory structure and move core infrastructure modules
- **Time Estimate**: 2-3 hours
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Create pipeline directory structure
  - Move core, monitoring, orchestration, quality modules
  - Move test infrastructure
  - Resolve merge conflicts

### Issue #135: [Refactoring 2/5] Migrate Pipeline Stages
- **Depends on**: #134
- **Scope**: Migrate all pipeline stage modules to new structure
- **Time Estimate**: 3-4 hours
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Migrate metadata collection (from src/data/)
  - Migrate paper filtering (from src/filtering/)
  - Consolidate PDF modules (discovery, download, storage)
  - Consolidate extraction modules
  - Migrate analysis modules

### Issue #136: [Refactoring 3/5] Update Imports & Configuration
- **Depends on**: #135
- **Scope**: Update all imports and configuration files
- **Time Estimate**: 3-4 hours
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Create automated import update script
  - Update all Python imports
  - Update pyproject.toml and pytest.ini
  - Fix circular imports

### Issue #137: [Refactoring 4/5] Implement Orchestrators & Resolve Conflicts
- **Depends on**: #136
- **Scope**: Implement orchestrators and resolve conflicts
- **Time Estimate**: 2-3 hours
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Implement stage orchestrators
  - Create main pipeline orchestrator
  - Resolve VenueCollectionOrchestrator conflict
  - Consolidate duplicate sources
  - Create unified data models

### Issue #138: [Refactoring 5/5] Testing & Documentation
- **Depends on**: #137
- **Scope**: Comprehensive testing and documentation
- **Time Estimate**: 2-3 hours
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Run comprehensive test suite
  - Validate performance
  - Update all documentation
  - Create migration guide
  - Final verification

## Total Estimated Time: 12-16 hours

## Key Benefits of Multi-Issue Approach

1. **Risk Mitigation**: Problems caught early at review checkpoints
2. **Manageable PRs**: 200-400 files per PR instead of 1000+
3. **Clear Progress**: Visible milestones and dependencies
4. **Flexibility**: Can pause/adjust between phases
5. **Better Reviews**: Reviewers can focus on specific aspects

## Review Checkpoints

1. After infrastructure setup (Issue #134) - Verify structure
2. After module migration (Issue #135) - Ensure nothing lost
3. After import updates (Issue #136) - Confirm all imports work
4. After orchestrator implementation (Issue #137) - Test pipeline flow
5. Final validation (Issue #138) - Comprehensive testing

## Next Steps

1. Start with Issue #134 on a feature branch
2. Create PRs for each issue sequentially
3. Merge to main only after all issues complete
4. Monitor for any issues in first week after deployment

## Success Metrics

- All tests passing with >90% coverage
- No performance regressions
- Clear documentation and migration guide
- Successful adoption by team
- No breaking changes for existing functionality
