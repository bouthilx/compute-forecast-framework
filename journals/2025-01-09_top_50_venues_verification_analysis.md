# Top 50 Venues Verification Analysis

**Date**: January 9, 2025  
**Task**: Verify top 50 venues from venues_final_cumulative_coverage.csv for scraper implementation feasibility  
**Analyst**: Claude  

## Executive Summary

Conducted comprehensive verification of the top 50 venues from the cumulative coverage CSV to assess scraper implementation feasibility. Key findings:

- **37 out of 50 venues (74%) are implementable** 
- **23 venues are fully open access** (much higher than initially assumed)
- **12 venues have medium feasibility** (subscription with API/open access options)
- **13 venues are truly behind paywalls** requiring subscription access

## Methodology

Instead of making assumptions about paywall status, I systematically verified each venue by:

1. **Direct website verification** - Checked actual venue websites
2. **Access model analysis** - Determined subscription vs open access status
3. **API availability assessment** - Identified venues with programmatic access
4. **Publisher platform analysis** - Examined hosting platforms (IEEE Xplore, ACM DL, etc.)

## Implementation Recommendations

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (6-9h)
Extend existing scrapers for venues using same platforms:
- **AISTATS, UAI** â†’ Extend MLRScraper (PMLR)
- **COLM** â†’ Extend OpenReviewScraper

### Phase 2: High-Value Open Access (30-45h)
Focus on fully open access venues with high paper counts:
- **AAAI** (67 papers) - Conference proceedings
- **TMLR** (203 papers) - OpenReview journal
- **Scientific Reports** (35 papers) - Nature open access
- **JMLR** (28 papers) - Classic ML journal
- **AAMAS** (11 papers) - Conference proceedings

### Phase 3: Medium Difficulty (24-36h)
Implement API/subscription venues with good access:
- **Nature** (94 papers) - High impact, has API
- **ICRA** (30 papers) - IEEE Xplore
- **IROS** (19 papers) - IEEE Xplore
- **SIGIR** (15 papers) - ACM Digital Library

### Realistic Target: 30 Venues
- **6 existing + 17 high feasibility + 7 medium feasibility = 30 venues**
- **Covers 60% of top 50 venues**
- **Represents the most accessible and high-impact venues**

## Technical Architecture Implications

### Registry Extensions Needed
```python
# Add to _venue_mapping in registry.py
"aistats": "MLRScraper",  # Extend existing
"uai": "MLRScraper",     # Extend existing
"colm": "OpenReviewScraper",  # Extend existing
"aaai": "AAAIScraper",   # New scraper
"jmlr": "JMLRScraper",   # New scraper
# ... etc
```

### New Scraper Categories
1. **Journal Scrapers**: JMLR, TMLR, Scientific Reports
2. **IEEE Scrapers**: ICRA, IROS, ICASSP (shared base)
3. **ACM Scrapers**: SIGIR, FAccT, Computing Surveys (shared base)
4. **Medical Journal Scrapers**: BMJ Open, Molecular Autism
5. **Publisher-Specific**: Cell Reports, eLife, Frontiers

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk (High Success Probability)
- All Category B venues (open access)
- OpenReview-based venues
- PMLR proceedings

### Medium Risk (Moderate Success Probability)
- IEEE venues (access restrictions possible)
- ACM venues (member access preferred)
- Nature API (rate limiting)

### High Risk (Lower Success Probability)
- Subscription venues without clear API
- Venues with complex authentication
- Publishers with strict scraping policies

## Conclusion

The verification revealed that **74% of top 50 venues are implementable**, with nearly half being fully open access. This provides a solid foundation for comprehensive coverage of the research landscape while focusing on accessible venues.

The analysis supports targeting **30 venues** as a realistic implementation goal, which would provide excellent coverage for the computational requirements analysis project while avoiding complex authentication and subscription barriers.

**Next Steps:**
1. Implement Phase 1 extensions (quick wins)
2. Begin Phase 2 open access scrapers
3. Evaluate Phase 3 venues based on API availability
4. Monitor venue access policies for changes

**Key Success Factors:**
- Focus on verified open access venues
- Leverage existing scraper patterns
- Build robust error handling for API-based venues
- Maintain flexibility for venue access changes
