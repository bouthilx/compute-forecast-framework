# Issue #93: JMLR/TMLR Site Scraper - Implementation Complete

**Date**: 2025-07-02
**Issue**: #93 - [PDF-JMLR] Implement JMLR/TMLR Site Scraper
**Status**: COMPLETED

## Implementation Summary

Successfully implemented the JMLR/TMLR PDF collector within the estimated 2-3 hour timeframe.

### What Was Implemented

1. **JMLRCollector Class** (`src/pdf_discovery/sources/jmlr_collector.py`)
   - Inherits from `BasePDFCollector`
   - Supports both JMLR and TMLR paper discovery
   - JMLR: Direct URL construction using volume/paper ID pattern
   - TMLR: HTML scraping to find matching papers

2. **Key Features**
   - Automatic detection of JMLR vs TMLR papers based on venue/journal fields
   - Volume and paper ID extraction from URLs
   - Fuzzy title matching for TMLR papers
   - Proper error handling and logging
   - Confidence scoring (0.95 for verified JMLR, 0.90 for discovered TMLR)

3. **Testing**
   - Complete unit test suite (10 tests, all passing)
   - Integration test framework (skipped tests requiring network access)
   - Proper mocking and error case handling

### Technical Details

**URL Patterns Implemented:**
- JMLR: `https://jmlr.org/papers/v{volume}/{paper_id}.pdf`
- TMLR: `https://jmlr.org/tmlr/papers/` (requires HTML parsing)

**Paper Detection Logic:**
- Checks both `venue` and `journal` fields for JMLR/TMLR identification
- Case-insensitive matching
- Handles various naming variations

**Integration Points:**
- Added to `src/pdf_discovery/sources/__init__.py` exports
- Compatible with existing PDF discovery framework
- Works with deduplication engine

### Code Quality
- All unit tests passing (100% success rate)
- Linting checks passed (ruff)
- Follows existing codebase patterns and conventions
- Proper error handling and logging

### Files Created/Modified
1. `src/pdf_discovery/sources/jmlr_collector.py` - Main implementation
2. `src/pdf_discovery/sources/__init__.py` - Added exports
3. `tests/unit/pdf_discovery/sources/test_jmlr_collector.py` - Unit tests
4. `tests/integration/pdf_discovery/test_jmlr_integration.py` - Integration tests

### Next Steps
The JMLR/TMLR collector is now ready for integration into the main PDF discovery pipeline. It can be instantiated and added to the list of collectors in the PDFDiscoveryFramework.

### Time Spent
Approximately 2 hours - well within the S (2-3h) estimate.

## Conclusion
Issue #93 has been successfully completed. The JMLR/TMLR PDF collector is fully implemented, tested, and ready for use in the PDF discovery pipeline.
