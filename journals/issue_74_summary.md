# Issue #74 Summary: Execute M3-1 Benchmark Extraction

**Timestamp**: 2025-07-01 19:20
**Title**: Current Status and Critical Path Forward

## Issue Overview

**Objective**: Execute benchmark extraction infrastructure on existing paper corpus to generate computational requirement baselines for M3-2.

**Target**: Extract computational requirements from 180-360 benchmark papers

## Current Status

### What Was Accomplished

1. **Created extraction pipeline** (`execute_benchmark_extraction.py`)
   - Filters 362 benchmark papers from 804 total
   - Identifies SOTA papers and target institutions
   - Runs extraction across 18 domain/year batches

2. **Attempted extraction**
   - **Result**: 1.9% success rate (7/362 papers)
   - **Root cause**: No full text access, only abstracts
   - Generated CSV outputs (empty fields)

3. **Analyzed PDF availability**
   - Semantic Scholar API: 40% have `openAccessPdf`
   - Basic implementation achieved 50% coverage
   - Identified bugs in ArXiv parser

4. **Venue analysis completed**
   - Top 6 venues contain 512 papers (37.7%)
   - NeurIPS (152), ICML (122), ICLR (94) are top 3
   - Most papers from 2022-2024

### Critical Findings

1. **Abstracts are insufficient**
   - Computational details are in methods/appendix sections
   - Affiliations require full author sections
   - Current approach cannot succeed

2. **PDF acquisition is mandatory**
   - Without PDFs: 1.9% extraction rate
   - With PDFs: Expected 30-40% extraction rate
   - This is a 20x improvement

3. **Venue-specific approaches needed**
   - Each conference has different PDF access methods
   - Generic approaches miss 50%+ of available PDFs

## Next Steps

### Option A: Full PDF Infrastructure (5-6 days)

1. **Day 1-2**: Implement top conference sources
   - NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR loaders
   - Expected: 368 papers covered

2. **Day 3-4**: General sources
   - Fix ArXiv, add Google Scholar
   - Expected: +400 papers

3. **Day 5**: Manual gaps & extraction
   - Download remaining high-value papers
   - Run full extraction pipeline

**Outcome**: 95% PDF coverage, 30-40% extraction success

### Option B: Targeted Approach (2-3 days)

1. **Day 1**: Fix current implementation
   - Debug ArXiv parser
   - Add top 3 conference sources
   - Expected: 50-60% coverage

2. **Day 2**: Manual enhancement
   - Download PDFs for top 100 papers manually
   - Run extraction

**Outcome**: 70% PDF coverage, 25-30% extraction success

### Option C: Pivot Strategy (1 day)

1. **Accept current limitations**
   - Work with 7 successfully extracted papers
   - Manually annotate 50 papers
   - Lower M3-2 expectations

**Outcome**: Minimal viable data for basic analysis

## Recommendation

**Pursue Option B (Targeted Approach)** because:

1. **Time efficient**: 2-3 days vs 5-6 days
2. **High impact**: Covers majority of Mila papers
3. **Risk balanced**: Combines automation with manual work
4. **M3-2 enabling**: Provides sufficient data for analysis

## Immediate Actions

1. **Fix ArXiv parser bug** (1 hour)
2. **Implement NeurIPS PDF source** (3 hours)  
3. **Test on 50 papers** (1 hour)
4. **Decide on continued investment**

## Impact on M3-2

Without PDF acquisition:
- **Cannot proceed** with computational baseline analysis
- **Missing 93%** of potential data
- **No affiliation data** for suppression analysis

With targeted PDF acquisition:
- **Can proceed** with meaningful analysis
- **70% data coverage** expected
- **Sufficient** for trend identification

## Conclusion

The current 1.9% extraction rate makes M3-2 impossible. PDF acquisition is not optional - it's critical path. The targeted approach (Option B) offers the best balance of effort and results, enabling M3-2 to proceed with meaningful data while managing time investment.
