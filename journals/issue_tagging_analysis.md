## Difficult to Categorize Issues

Several issues presented categorization challenges:

1. **Issue #37 (M11-1: Dual-Tier Defense Framework)**: Could be either Design or Implementation. Chose Design as "Framework" suggests architectural planning.

2. **Issues #24, #26 (Mock Data & Validation Engine)**: These testing infrastructure issues blur the line between Implementation and Testing domains. Tagged as Implementation/Testing to reflect their infrastructure nature.

3. **Issue #44 (Organization Classification System)**: Could be Analysis or Extraction domain. Chose Analysis as classification involves analytical judgment beyond simple data extraction.

4. **Issues #63-67 (Report sections)**: The distinction between Writing work type and Writing domain creates redundancy, but accurately reflects that these are writing tasks about written deliverables.

5. **Issue #38 (Temporal Evolution Visualizations)**: Could be Implementation or Execution. Chose Execution assuming visualization generation from existing data rather than building new visualization tools.

## Project Phase Analysis

Based on the issue patterns, the project appears to follow these phases:

1. **Infrastructure Setup** (Issues 3-12, 25-27): Building collection and processing systems
2. **Data Collection** (Issues 1-2, 60): Gathering papers and datasets
3. **Extraction & Processing** (Issues 28-30, 45, 56, 58, 61): Extracting computational metrics
4. **Analysis** (Issues 31-35, 57, 59, 62, 64): Analyzing trends and patterns
5. **Validation & Testing** (Issues 13-14, 16, 36-37, 41-43, 46): Ensuring quality
6. **Report Generation** (Issues 39-40, 63-67): Creating final deliverables

This progression shows a well-structured research project moving from data collection through analysis to final reporting.
