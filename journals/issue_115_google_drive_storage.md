# Journal: Issue #115 - Google Drive Storage Implementation

## 2025-07-02 - Google Drive Storage for PDFs

### Analysis
Implemented Google Drive storage backend for PDFs to avoid repository bloat when storing 450-580 research papers (~0.5-3GB). The solution leverages Google Suite infrastructure already available to the organization.

### Implementation Approach

#### 1. **Core Storage Module (`src/pdf_storage/`)**
Created three main components:
- `GoogleDriveStore`: Low-level Google Drive API operations (upload, download, list, delete)
- `PDFManager`: High-level manager with local caching layer and metadata tracking
- `PDFDiscoveryStorage`: Integration bridge between PDF discovery and storage systems

Key design decisions:
- Used service account authentication for automated access
- Implemented local caching with TTL to minimize API calls
- Added metadata tracking in JSON format for quick lookups
- Batch operations support for efficient bulk uploads

#### 2. **Framework Integration**
Modified `PDFDiscoveryFramework` to accept optional storage backend:
- Added `storage_backend` parameter to constructor
- Created `discover_and_store_pdfs()` method for integrated workflow
- Maintained backward compatibility (storage is optional)

#### 3. **Setup and Migration Tools**
Created user-friendly scripts:
- `setup_google_drive.py`: Interactive wizard for initial configuration
- `migrate_pdfs_to_drive.py`: Tool for migrating existing PDFs with dry-run support

#### 4. **Configuration Management**
- Used `.env` file for credentials (excluded from git)
- Created comprehensive `.gitignore` to prevent PDF and credential commits
- Added example usage file for developers

### Technical Details

**Dependencies added:**
- `google-api-python-client>=2.100.0`
- `google-auth>=2.20.0`  
- `python-dotenv>=1.0.0`

**Storage workflow:**
1. PDF Discovery finds PDF URLs
2. Downloader fetches PDFs to temporary cache
3. Storage backend uploads to Google Drive
4. Local cache maintains recent PDFs for fast access
5. Metadata tracks Drive file IDs and access times

**Cache management:**
- Configurable cache size limit (default 10GB)
- TTL-based expiration (default 7 days)
- LRU eviction when size limit exceeded

### Outcomes

✅ **Completed all implementation tasks:**
- Core storage module with Google Drive API integration
- PDF Manager with intelligent caching
- Seamless integration with existing PDF discovery pipeline
- Interactive setup wizard (<30 minutes setup time)
- Migration tool for existing PDFs
- Updated dependencies and documentation

✅ **Key benefits achieved:**
- Zero repository bloat - PDFs stored externally
- Maintains fast local access via caching
- Team collaboration through Drive permissions
- Automated discovery → download → store workflow
- Progress tracking for long operations

### Usage Example

```python
# Initialize with storage
from src.pdf_storage import GoogleDriveStore, PDFDiscoveryStorage
from src.pdf_discovery.core import PDFDiscoveryFramework

drive_store = GoogleDriveStore(credentials_path, folder_id)
storage = PDFDiscoveryStorage(drive_store)
discovery = PDFDiscoveryFramework(storage_backend=storage)

# Discover and store in one operation
results = discovery.discover_and_store_pdfs(
    papers,
    download_pdfs=True,
    upload_to_drive=True
)
```

### Next Steps

The implementation is complete and ready for use. To get started:
1. Run `python scripts/setup_google_drive.py` to configure
2. Use `python scripts/migrate_pdfs_to_drive.py` to migrate existing PDFs
3. Update discovery scripts to use the new storage backend

Estimated time: **M (5.5 hours)** - completed within budget
