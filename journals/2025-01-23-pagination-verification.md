# 2025-01-23 - Verification: OpenReview Pagination and Filtering

## User Concern

After implementing `efficient_iterget` with `limit=1000`, the user was concerned that:
1. We might be missing papers beyond the first 1000
2. Paper filtering (rejecting rejected/withdrawn papers) might be broken

## Verification Results

### 1. Pagination Works Correctly ✓

Tested `efficient_iterget` with ICLR 2024:
- Set `limit=100` (small batch size)
- Successfully fetched 500+ papers
- Confirmed that `limit` parameter is the **batch size**, not a total limit
- The function automatically paginates through all results

```python
submissions = tools.efficient_iterget(
    client.get_notes,
    content={"venueid": venue_id},
    limit=1000  # This is batch size, not total limit!
)
```

### 2. Paper Filtering Intact ✓

Verified all iterator methods still have proper filtering:

#### v1 Iterator (_get_conference_submissions_v1_iter)
```python
# Line 713-714
if decision and decision.lower() in ["rejected", "withdrawn"]:
    rejected_count += 1
    continue  # Skip rejected papers
```

#### v2 Iterator (_get_conference_submissions_v2_iter)
```python
# Line 792-794
if decision and decision.lower() in ["rejected", "withdrawn"]:
    rejected_count += 1
    continue  # Skip rejected papers
```

#### Venueid Iterator (_get_accepted_by_venueid_iter)
- Uses `content={"venueid": venue_id}` which only returns accepted papers
- No rejected papers to filter

### 3. No Papers Will Be Missed

The implementation correctly:
1. Fetches ALL papers using pagination (in batches of 1000)
2. Filters out rejected/withdrawn papers as before
3. Respects the `--max-papers` limit if specified
4. Properly tracks accepted vs rejected counts

## Conclusion

The streaming implementation is correct and safe:
- **Pagination**: Works automatically, fetching all papers in batches
- **Filtering**: Rejected/withdrawn papers are still filtered out
- **Completeness**: No papers will be missed
- **Performance**: Better memory usage and responsiveness

The `limit=1000` parameter is just an optimization for batch size, similar to how the original `iterget_notes` works for v1 API.
