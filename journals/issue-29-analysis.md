# Issue #29 Analysis: Academic Benchmark Extraction

## Timestamp: 2025-07-01

### Overview
Analyzing issue #29 which involves implementing an Academic Benchmark Extraction system to extract computational requirements from 180-360 academic papers across NLP, CV, and RL domains.

### Work Summary

The issue requires building a comprehensive extraction pipeline with the following components:

1. **Core Extraction Pipeline**
   - `AcademicBenchmarkExtractor`: Main class for extracting computational requirements
   - Domain-specific extractors for NLP, CV, and RL
   - Parallel processing capabilities via `ExtractionWorkflowManager`
   - Quality assurance system with validation and reporting

2. **Key Features Required**
   - Extract computational metrics (GPU hours, type, count, training time, parameters, etc.)
   - Identify state-of-the-art papers
   - Domain-specific metric extraction
   - Confidence scoring for extractions
   - Manual review queue generation
   - Standardized export format

3. **Success Metrics**
   - 180-360 papers extracted (60-120 per domain)
   - 80%+ extraction rate
   - 60%+ high confidence extractions
   - Balanced coverage across years (2019-2024)

### Prerequisites Analysis

#### Existing Components (✅)

1. **Core Models**
   - `Paper` and `ComputationalAnalysis` classes exist in `src/data/models.py`
   - Models have all necessary fields for computational requirements storage

2. **Computational Analysis Infrastructure**
   - `ComputationalAnalyzer` in `src/analysis/computational/analyzer.py` provides:
     - Automated extraction of computational requirements
     - Confidence scoring
     - Pattern-based resource metrics extraction
     - Keyword-based analysis
     - Experimental content detection

3. **Extraction Infrastructure**
   - `extraction_patterns.py` - Regex patterns for GPU, training time, parameters, costs
   - `extraction_workflow.py` - Multi-stage workflow orchestration
   - `extraction_protocol.py` - Structured extraction protocol
   - `quality_control.py` - Quality validation system
   - `extraction_forms.py` - Form management with CSV export capability

4. **Domain Collection**
   - `domain_collector.py` - Already handles domain-based paper collection
   - Supports collecting papers by domain and year

#### Missing Components (❌)

1. **Benchmark-Specific Classes**
   - `BenchmarkPaper` dataclass
   - `ExtractionBatch` dataclass
   - `BenchmarkExport` dataclass
   - `ExtractionQA` dataclass

2. **Domain-Specific Extractors**
   - `NLPBenchmarkExtractor`
   - `CVBenchmarkExtractor`
   - `RLBenchmarkExtractor`

3. **Batch Processing Infrastructure**
   - `AcademicBenchmarkExtractor` wrapper class
   - `ExtractionWorkflowManager` for parallel processing
   - `ExtractionQualityAssurance` for coverage validation

4. **Export Functionality**
   - CSV batch export for multiple papers
   - Standardized export format implementation
   - Aggregation and reporting modules

### Conclusion

The codebase already contains sophisticated extraction capabilities at the single-paper level. The main implementation work involves:

1. **Creating wrapper classes** that leverage existing extraction infrastructure
2. **Building batch processing** capabilities on top of existing analyzers
3. **Implementing domain-specific logic** for NLP, CV, and RL papers
4. **Adding CSV export functionality** for batch results
5. **Creating quality assurance** modules to ensure extraction coverage

The existing `ComputationalAnalyzer` and extraction workflow provide all core functionality - they just need to be orchestrated for batch processing of benchmark papers.

### Dependencies from Other Issues

No blocking dependencies identified. The required infrastructure (models, analyzers, extraction patterns) is already in place from previous issues.

### Implementation Plan

#### Day 1: Core Infrastructure
1. Create data models (`BenchmarkPaper`, `ExtractionBatch`, etc.)
2. Implement `AcademicBenchmarkExtractor` wrapping existing `ComputationalAnalyzer`
3. Add batch processing logic to handle multiple papers
4. Create SOTA paper identification logic

#### Day 2: Domain-Specific Logic
1. Implement `NLPBenchmarkExtractor` with NLP-specific metrics
2. Implement `CVBenchmarkExtractor` with CV-specific metrics
3. Implement `RLBenchmarkExtractor` with RL-specific metrics
4. Create `ExtractionWorkflowManager` for parallel processing

#### Day 3: Quality & Export
1. Implement `ExtractionQualityAssurance` for validation
2. Create CSV export functionality
3. Add reporting and aggregation features
4. Test with sample papers and refine

### Key Implementation Notes

1. **Leverage Existing Infrastructure**: The existing `ComputationalAnalyzer` already handles extraction with confidence scoring - we just need to wrap it for batch processing

2. **Domain Detection**: Can use existing keyword analysis to identify paper domains

3. **Parallel Processing**: Use Python's `concurrent.futures` for parallel extraction

4. **Quality Control**: The existing quality control system can be extended for batch validation

5. **Export Format**: Create standardized CSV format based on the `BenchmarkExport` dataclass specification
