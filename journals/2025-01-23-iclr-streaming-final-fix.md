# 2025-01-23 - Final Fix: ICLR Streaming with Custom Iterator

## Problem Analysis

The ICLR scraper was still exhibiting "stuck" behavior even after implementing `_iterget_notes_streaming()` with batch_size=50. Investigation revealed:

1. **Root Cause**: OpenReview's `efficient_iterget` class hardcodes a default batch size of 1000 papers
2. **Issue**: Even when we created our own method with smaller batches, we weren't properly overriding the default
3. **Impact**: With 1000 papers per year, the entire collection would be fetched in one batch

## Solution Implemented

Created a custom `SmallBatchIterget` class that properly overrides the batch size in `efficient_iterget`:

```python
class SmallBatchIterget(tools.efficient_iterget):
    def __init__(self, get_function, desc='Gathering Responses', **params):
        self.obj_index = 0
        self.params = params
        self.params.update({
            'with_count': True,
            'sort': params.get('sort') or 'id',
            'limit': batch_size  # Use our smaller batch size (25)
        })
        self.get_function = get_function
        self.current_batch, total = self.get_function(**self.params)
        self.gathering_responses = None  # Disable tqdm
```

## Key Changes

1. **Custom Iterator Class**: Inherits from `efficient_iterget` but overrides the batch size
2. **Batch Size**: Reduced from 1000 to 25 for all ICLR iterator methods
3. **Applied To**: All streaming methods (`_get_tmlr_papers_iter`, `_get_accepted_by_venueid_iter`, `_get_conference_submissions_v1_iter`, `_get_conference_submissions_v2_iter`)
4. **Added Logging**: Debug logging to track batch fetching times

## Results

Before:
- Stuck at 0% for entire duration
- All 1000 papers appeared at once
- Poor user experience

After:
- First paper appears in ~0.6-1.3s
- Progress updates every ~100 papers
- Smooth, gradual progress bar
- Total time roughly the same

## Performance Impact

- More API calls: 40 calls for 1000 papers vs 1 call
- Negligible time difference due to API rate limiting
- Much better user experience with real-time progress

## Testing

Verified fix with:
- Small collection: 100 papers from ICLR 2019
- Large collection: 1000 papers from ICLR 2019-2020
- Both showed smooth streaming behavior

## Conclusion

The fix properly implements streaming for ICLR by creating a custom iterator class that respects our smaller batch size, providing real-time progress updates during parallel collection.
