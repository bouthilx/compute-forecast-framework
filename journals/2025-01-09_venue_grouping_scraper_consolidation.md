- **31 venues** need new scraper functionality
- **13 venues** behind strict paywalls (excluded)

### **Proposed Solution**
- **15 total scrapers** needed (including existing)
- **9 new scrapers** to implement
- **6 existing scrapers** to extend/reuse

### **Coverage Achievement**
- **37 out of 50 venues** covered (74%)
- **Average venues per scraper**: 2.47
- **Maximum reuse**: IEEE Xplore (8 venues), ACM DL (5 venues)

## Recommended Implementation Order

### **Phase 1: Quick Wins** (1 week)
1. Extend PMLR scraper (+3 venues)
2. Extend OpenReview scraper (+3 venues)
3. Implement JMLR scraper (+2 venues)

**Result: +8 venues with minimal effort**

### **Phase 2: High-Impact Platforms** (2 weeks)
4. Implement Nature Portfolio scraper (+3 venues)
5. Implement AAAI scraper (+1 venue)
6. Implement Cell Press scraper (+2 venues)

**Result: +6 high-impact venues**

### **Phase 3: Subscription Platforms** (2 weeks)
7. Implement IEEE Xplore scraper (+8 venues)
8. Implement ACM DL scraper (+5 venues)

**Result: +13 venues (if access available)**

### **Phase 4: Remaining Venues** (1 week)
9. Individual scrapers for remaining open access venues

**Result: Complete coverage of feasible venues**

## Key Insights

1. **Platform Consolidation**: Many venues share common platforms, enabling significant code reuse
2. **OpenReview Growth**: Emerging as a major platform for AI/ML conferences
3. **Publisher APIs**: Nature, IEEE, and ACM offer APIs that could simplify implementation
4. **Open Access Trend**: More venues than expected are fully open access
5. **Scraper Reusability**: Average of 2.47 venues per scraper shows good consolidation opportunity

This consolidation reduces implementation complexity while maintaining comprehensive coverage of the top venues.
