# Issue #28: Extraction Template Development Analysis

**Date**: 2025-07-01  
**Title**: Planning M2-1 Extraction Template Development

## Analysis Requested
Plan implementation of issue #28 (Extraction Template Development) by:
1. Reading the issue details
2. Verifying dependencies exist in codebase
3. Identifying any missing requirements

## Process

### 1. Issue Analysis
Retrieved issue #28 details using `gh issue view 28`. The issue aims to create standardized templates for extracting computational resource requirements from papers.

Key requirements:
- Build on existing ComputationalAnalyzer
- Create extraction templates for different ML domains (NLP, CV, RL)
- Implement validation rules for extracted values
- Normalize values to standard units
- Generate confidence scores

### 2. Dependency Verification

Searched for required components:

**✅ ComputationalAnalyzer** (package/src/analysis/computational/analyzer.py)
- Sophisticated analyzer already extracting computational metrics
- Performs keyword analysis, pattern extraction, richness scoring
- Has confidence scoring capability

**✅ Data Models** (package/src/data/models.py)
- Paper model with full metadata support
- ComputationalAnalysis dataclass storing analysis results

**❌ Extraction Template Infrastructure**
- No existing extraction module or templates
- Needs to be created from scratch

### 3. Issue Adjustment Discovery

Found critical comment on issue showing scope adjustment:
- Original plan assumed building extraction from scratch
- Actual codebase already has sophisticated extraction in ComputationalAnalyzer
- Adjusted scope: Build template standardization layer on top of existing analyzer

## Outcomes

### Implementation Plan

Based on findings, the implementation should:

1. **Create new extraction module** at `package/src/extraction/`
   
2. **Build on existing analyzer** rather than replacing it:
   ```python
   class ExtractionTemplateEngine:
       def __init__(self):
           self.analyzer = ComputationalAnalyzer()
       
       def extract_to_template(self, paper: Paper) -> Dict:
           # Use existing analysis
           analysis = self.analyzer.analyze(paper)
           # Format to standard template
           return self.format_template(analysis)
   ```

3. **Focus on value-add features**:
   - Template standardization for consistent output format
   - Enhanced confidence scoring per field
   - Validation rules defining acceptable ranges
   - Normalization improvements
   - Aggregation layer for multiple extractions

4. **File structure**:
   ```
   src/extraction/
   ├── __init__.py
   ├── template_engine.py      # Main template engine
   ├── validation_rules.py     # Field validation logic
   ├── normalization_engine.py # Value normalization
   ├── default_templates.py    # Pre-defined templates
   └── templates/             # Template definitions
       ├── nlp_training.yaml
       ├── cv_training.yaml
       └── rl_training.yaml
   ```

### Key Insights

1. **Leverage existing work**: The ComputationalAnalyzer is already sophisticated - don't reinvent the wheel
2. **Focus on standardization**: The real value is in creating consistent, validated output formats
3. **Template approach**: Allows domain-specific extraction rules while reusing core analyzer
4. **Validation is critical**: Need to catch unrealistic values (e.g., 10000 GPUs for academic paper)

### Next Steps

Ready to implement with clear understanding of:
- What exists (analyzer, models)
- What's needed (template layer, validation)
- How to integrate (build on top, not replace)

Estimated time: 4-6 hours as specified in issue
