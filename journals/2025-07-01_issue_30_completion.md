# Issue #30 Completion: Mila Paper Processing

**Date**: 2025-07-01  
**Issue**: #30 - M4-1: Mila Paper Processing  
**PR**: #75  
**Status**: Completed

## Summary

Successfully implemented the Mila paper processing pipeline with suppression indicators. The implementation extracts computational requirements and identifies suppressed demand from Mila papers.

## What Was Delivered

### 1. Paper Selection System
- `MilaPaperSelector` class with domain classification
- Computational content filtering (handles papers with/without abstracts)
- Selected 124 papers balanced across years and domains

### 2. Suppression Templates
- Extended extraction templates with 4 categories of suppression indicators
- Suppression score calculation (0-1 scale)
- Domain-specific templates (NLP, CV, RL)

### 3. Extraction Pipeline
- Automated extraction script processing selected papers
- Extracts GPU info, training time, parameters, GPU-hours
- Identifies suppression indicators and calculates scores

### 4. Results & Outputs
- JSON: Full extraction results with metadata
- CSV: Simplified tabular format
- Summary report with findings and recommendations

## Key Results

- **Papers processed**: 124
- **Successful extractions**: 7 (5.6%)
- **High suppression cases**: 1
- **Parameter range**: 1B - 15.5B
- **Training times**: 48-72 hours

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Low Abstract Availability
- Only 49.4% of papers had abstracts
- **Solution**: Implemented title-based heuristics for ML paper detection

### Challenge 2: Limited Extraction Rate
- Only 7 papers had extractable computational details
- **Solution**: Created comprehensive report acknowledging limitations and suggesting PDF processing

### Challenge 3: Suppression Detection
- Most papers don't explicitly mention constraints
- **Solution**: Implemented multi-faceted detection (experimental scope, scale, methods, explicit mentions)

## Lessons Learned

1. **Abstract limitations** significantly impact extraction rates
2. **Title-based classification** can work but has limitations
3. **Suppression indicators** are rarely explicit - need inference
4. **PDF processing** would dramatically improve results

## Time Spent

Approximately 8 hours total:
- Hours 1-3: Paper selection and domain classification
- Hours 4-5: Suppression template implementation
- Hours 6-7: Extraction pipeline and processing
- Hour 8: Validation, reporting, and PR creation

## Next Steps for Project

1. Manual review of high-impact papers without data
2. Consider implementing PDF extraction
3. Cross-reference with external sources (GitHub, model cards)
4. Integrate with benchmark data for gap analysis

## Code Quality

- Full test coverage for all new components
- Clear separation of concerns
- Reusable components for future analysis
- Comprehensive documentation

The implementation successfully meets the requirements while acknowledging data limitations and providing clear paths for enhancement.
