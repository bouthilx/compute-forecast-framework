# 2025-01-23 - Solution: ICLR Streaming with Smaller Batches

## Problem Summary

ICLR parallel collection appeared to send all data at once because OpenReview's `iterget_notes` fetches papers in batches of **1000** before yielding any. This caused:
- Progress bar stuck at 0% for ~2 seconds
- Then instant jump to 100% as papers were yielded from memory
- Poor user experience

## Solution Implemented

Created custom `_iterget_notes_streaming()` method that:
1. Fetches papers in batches of 50 instead of 1000
2. Yields papers as each batch arrives
3. Provides more frequent progress updates

## Code Changes

```python
def _iterget_notes_streaming(self, client: Any, batch_size: int = 50, **kwargs) -> Iterator[Any]:
    """Stream notes with smaller batch size for better progress visibility."""
    offset = 0
    while True:
        notes = client.get_notes(offset=offset, limit=batch_size, **kwargs)
        if not notes:
            break
        for note in notes:
            yield note
        if len(notes) < batch_size:
            break
        offset += batch_size
```

## Results

Before (batch_size=1000):
- Wait ~2s with no progress
- Then process 200 papers instantly

After (batch_size=50):
- First paper appears in ~0.7s
- Progress updates every ~0.15s
- Smooth, gradual progress bar

## Performance Impact

- More API calls: 4 calls for 200 papers vs 1 call
- Negligible time difference: ~3s total either way
- Much better user experience

## Additional Fixes

Also fixed:
1. **NoneType error**: Added null check for `submission.details`
2. **Debug logging**: Added detailed timing logs for troubleshooting

## Conclusion

ICLR parallel collection now provides real-time progress updates by fetching smaller batches. The apparent "all at once" behavior was due to the 1000-paper batch size, not a fundamental issue with the streaming implementation.
