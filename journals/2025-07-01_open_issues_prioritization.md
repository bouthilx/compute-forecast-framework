# Open Issues Prioritization Analysis

**Date**: 2025-07-01
**Analysis Type**: Deep analysis with ultrathink mode of all open GitHub issues

## Executive Summary

Analyzed all GitHub issues (#2-#47) to identify open issues and prioritize them based on dependencies, implementation readiness, and project value. Found 24 open issues out of 47 total issues.

## Open Issues Identified

Total Open Issues: 24
- #15, #17-#23, #25, #28 (partially implemented), #29-#36, #38-#41, #45-#46

## Analysis Methodology

1. **Repository Search**: Comprehensive search through codebase for issue references
2. **Commit History Analysis**: Examined commits to identify implemented vs open issues
3. **Dependency Mapping**: Analyzed milestone documents and issue descriptions for dependencies
4. **Phased Approach Discovery**: Found project follows a 15-milestone structure (M0-M14)

## Key Findings

### Project Structure
- **15 Milestones** covering the complete compute forecast pipeline:
  - M0: Integration Testing Framework
  - M1: Paper Selection/Author-Affiliation Filter
  - M2: Extraction Pipeline
  - M3-M4: Benchmark and Mila Data
  - M5-M10: Analysis phases (trends, gaps, projections)
  - M11-M14: Reporting and deliverables

### Issue Organization Pattern
- Issues #3-#15: Analysis components for compute forecasting
- Issues #16-#47: Implementation of various pipeline components
- Clear dependency chain between phases

### Critical Dependencies
1. **Phase 0** (Integration Testing): Blocks all analysis milestones
2. **Phase 1** (Data Collection): Independent components
3. **Phase 2** (Analysis): Iterative with circular dependencies
4. **Phase 3** (Integration): Requires all previous phases

## Prioritized Open Issues List

### Tier 1: High Priority - Ready to Implement
1. **Issue #28 - Extraction Template Development (M2-1)**
   - **Why**: Partially implemented, clear requirements exist
   - **Dependencies**: None blocking
   - **Impact**: Enables standardized data extraction

2. **Issue #15 - Next Integration Testing Component**
   - **Why**: Follows completed #3-#14 pattern
   - **Dependencies**: Builds on existing framework
   - **Impact**: Strengthens testing infrastructure

### Tier 2: Medium Priority - Clear Path Forward
3. **Issue #17 - Likely M2 Implementation**
   - **Why**: Next logical milestone after M1 completion
   - **Dependencies**: M0 complete, M1 infrastructure ready
   - **Impact**: Advances extraction pipeline

4. **Issue #18-#23 - M2-M5 Implementation Components**
   - **Why**: Core data processing pipeline
   - **Dependencies**: Sequential build on each other
   - **Impact**: Essential for analysis phases

### Tier 3: Analysis Phase - Requires Prerequisites
5. **Issue #29-#36 - M6-M10 Analysis Components**
   - **Why**: Core analysis functionality
   - **Dependencies**: Requires M1-M5 data pipeline
   - **Impact**: Produces key insights

### Tier 4: Reporting Phase - Final Stage
6. **Issue #38-#41 - M11-M13 Reporting Components**
   - **Why**: Visualization and report generation
   - **Dependencies**: All analysis complete
   - **Impact**: Delivers final product

7. **Issue #45-#46 - Final Refinements**
   - **Why**: Polish and additional features
   - **Dependencies**: Core functionality complete
   - **Impact**: Quality improvements

### Special Cases
- **Issue #25**: Gap in numbering, unclear purpose
- **Issue #28**: Partially implemented, needs completion per specifications

## Recommendations

1. **Start with Issue #28**: Complete the partial implementation to match full specifications
2. **Then Issue #15**: Continue integration testing framework pattern
3. **Follow milestone order**: Issues likely correspond to milestone numbers (17→M2, 18→M3, etc.)
4. **Batch related work**: Group issues by milestone for efficient implementation

## Technical Debt Notes

- Strong foundation already built (M0, M1 infrastructure)
- Clear architectural patterns established
- Good test coverage with integration testing framework
- Modular design allows parallel work on independent components

## Next Steps

1. Review Issue #28 specifications in detail
2. Complete implementation to match requirements
3. Move to Issue #15 for continued testing infrastructure
4. Begin M2 implementation with Issues #17-18
