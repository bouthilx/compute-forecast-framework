The study includes quantitative indicators of the Experiment from 06/18/2020 to 10/01/2020. Methods of social survey, descriptive statistics, assessment of diagnostic accuracy metrics were used. R e s u l t s a n d d i s c u s s i o n . During the first four months of the active phase of the Experiment, ten computer vision services were integrate into Unified Radiology Service of Moscow. More then 497 thousand studies have been successfully analyzed. Analyzes is carried out for 884 diagnostic devices in 293 medical organizations, 272 of them are actively involved. The involvement of medical organizations is 82%. The median time for automatic analysis of 1 study is 8 minutes. Overall, 63% of studies were analyzed in less than 15 minutes. At the beginning of the Experiment, 538 doctors had access to the system; in four months this number increased to 899. The involvement of doctors was 24%, which is slightly higher than the global indicators. According to the results of a sociological survey, the attitude to AI technologies of Moscow radiologists can be characterize as expectant, moderately optimistic. Radiologists have determined that the results of computer vision services are fully consistent with the real situation in 64% of cases. In 36% cases some inconsistencies were recorded; of this number, significant discrepancies took place in 6%, insignificant \u2013 in 23%. C o n c l u s i o n . Results of the Experiment\u2019s first four months can be consider as successful. A high level of involvement of radiologists is define. Special measures will be implement to increase the involvement of radiologists, as well as a comprehensive comparative assessment of the work of services at the further stages of the Experiment.",

Due to the need for expensive equipment, experienced radiologists, and the time-consuming in Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test, researchers find out the necessity to embrace X-ray images and Computed Tomography (CT) images based diagnosing. Wreak havoc of COVID-19 instigated me to review current emerging Artificial Intelligence(AI) based automatic diagnosing models through the statistical survey that will pave out the way of research. In this paper, I study different available research resources at the time span from April 2020 to July 2020. In order to help researchers in further research, I presented a statistical survey so that researchers can pick a preeminent diagnosing model. I took a look at 74 papers from April to July and specified preprocessing techniques, feature extraction, classification method, interpretability method, and experimental result. Moreover, I analyze training,testing and validation split ratio, as well as look into the dataset\u2019s availability publicly. Some researchers are able to gain noticeable performance by adopting their own local model. On the contrary, some researchers adopt an existing pre-trained model and achieve the utmost result. Some models need to feed huge data and some models outperform despite having small data. In the following sections, all of the criteria will be illustrated briefly.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), especially deep learning, have generated tremendous impacts throughout our society, including the tomographic medical imaging field. In contrast to computer vision and image analysis, which have been major application examples\n of deep learning and deal with existing images, tomographic medical imaging mainly produces cross-sectional or volumetric images of internal structures from sensor measurements. Recently, deep learning has started being actively developed worldwide for medical imaging, including both tomographic\n reconstruction and image analysis. While medical imaging is a well-established field, in which extensive teaching experience has been accumulated over the past few decades, updating the medical imaging course to reflect AI/ML influence is a new challenge given the rapidly changing landscape\n of AI-based medical imaging, particularly deep tomographic imaging. In the 2019 fall semester, the medical imaging course at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute was modified to include an AI framework with positive feedback from students. Encouragingly, many students showed a strong motivation\n to learn AI in classes and hands-on projects, as confirmed in their survey reports. In the 2020 fall semester, we improved this course further, incorporating new advances. This article describes our teaching philosophy, practice, and considerations with respect to integrating deep learning,\n tomographic imaging, and hands-on programming to redefine the medical imaging course. Furthermore, given the persistent pandemic, online teaching and examination have become an integral part of higher education. These needs will be addressed as well, with the hope of developing an open course\n in the future.",

    "abstract": "Different approaches to the study of computer vision have been taken into consideration. It begins with the collection of raw data and advances to methodologies and ideas that combine digital images, pattern recognition, machine learning, and computer graphics to produce new products, as well as new products themselves. In order to get crucial information, students can analyze images and videos to interpret events or descriptions, as well as discern patterns in the landscape, using computer vision. It makes use of a multi-spectrum application domain strategy in conjunction with a large amount of data in order to achieve its goals. In recent years, technological developments in computer vision have paved the way for the creation of novel agricultural applications. Precision yield forecasts for fruit and vegetable crops are particularly critical for improving harvesting, marketing, and logistics planning and execution. When a bridge is under stress or has a high volume of traffic, the geographical and temporal information provided by cars on the bridge reflects this. It is proposed to design a methodology for information gathering and dissemination by utilizing computer vision technology, which recognizes various items tracking and picture calibration via a quick regional neural convolution network, and a quick regional neural convolution network (Faster R-CNN). When dealing with small fish populations, it can be difficult to objectively assess the differences in behavior between individuals. The behavior of fish in aquaculture tanks has been studied with the use of a computer vision system that has been built in order to quantify these types of observations. Contained traffic load data is essential for bridge statistical analysis, security evaluation, and maintenance planning. This is particularly true for heavy trucks. From retail to agriculture, and across all industries, computer vision is having a big impact on organizations of all sizes and in all sectors. When a human eye is required to assess the situation, the significance of this becomes even more apparent. This paper provides information about computer vision technology, including short algorithms, issues, opportunities, and applications for computer vision in a range of fields in the year 2021, as well as information on computer vision in general. Information about computer vision applications in many fields is also included for the year 2021.",

    "abstract": "Background: The segment-anything model (SAM), introduced in April 2023, shows promise as a benchmark model and a universal solution to segment various natural images. It comes without previously-required re-training or fine-tuning specific to each new dataset. Purpose: To test SAM's accuracy in various medical image segmentation tasks and investigate potential factors that may affect its accuracy in medical images. Methods: SAM was tested on 12 public medical image segmentation datasets involving 7,451 subjects. The accuracy was measured by the Dice overlap between the algorithm-segmented and ground-truth masks. SAM was compared with five state-of-the-art algorithms specifically designed for medical image segmentation tasks. Associations of SAM's accuracy with six factors were computed, independently and jointly, including segmentation difficulties as measured by segmentation ability score and by Dice overlap in U-Net, image dimension, size of the target region, image modality, and contrast. Results: The Dice overlaps from SAM were significantly lower than the five medical-image-based algorithms in all 12 medical image segmentation datasets, by a margin of 0.1-0.5 and even 0.6-0.7 Dice. SAM-Semantic was significantly associated with medical image segmentation difficulty and the image modality, and SAM-Point and SAM-Box were significantly associated with image segmentation difficulty, image dimension, target region size, and target-vs-background contrast. All these 3 variations of SAM were more accurate in 2D medical images, larger target region sizes, easier cases with a higher Segmentation Ability score and higher U-Net Dice, and higher foreground-background contrast.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\n Natural language processing (NLP) is an important traditional field in computer science, but its application in medical research has faced many challenges. With the extensive digitalization of medical information globally and increasing importance of understanding and mining big data in the medical field, NLP is becoming more crucial.\n \n \n OBJECTIVE\n The goal of the research was to perform a systematic review on the use of NLP in medical research with the aim of understanding the global progress on NLP research outcomes, content, methods, and study groups involved.\n \n \n METHODS\n A systematic review was conducted using the PubMed database as a search platform. All published studies on the application of NLP in medicine (except biomedicine) during the 20 years between 1999 and 2018 were retrieved. The data obtained from these published studies were cleaned and structured. Excel (Microsoft Corp) and VOSviewer (Nees Jan van Eck and Ludo Waltman) were used to perform bibliometric analysis of publication trends, author orders, countries, institutions, collaboration relationships, research hot spots, diseases studied, and research methods.\n \n \n RESULTS\n A total of 3498 articles were obtained during initial screening, and 2336 articles were found to meet the study criteria after manual screening. The number of publications increased every year, with a significant growth after 2012 (number of publications ranged from 148 to a maximum of 302 annually). The United States has occupied the leading position since the inception of the field, with the largest number of articles published. The United States contributed to 63.01% (1472/2336) of all publications, followed by France (5.44%, 127/2336) and the United Kingdom (3.51%, 82/2336). The author with the largest number of articles published was Hongfang Liu (70), while St\u00e9phane Meystre (17) and Hua Xu (33) published the largest number of articles as the first and corresponding authors. Among the first author\u2019s affiliation institution, Columbia University published the largest number of articles, accounting for 4.54% (106/2336) of the total. Specifically, approximately one-fifth (17.68%, 413/2336) of the articles involved research on specific diseases, and the subject areas primarily focused on mental illness (16.46%, 68/413), breast cancer (5.81%, 24/413), and pneumonia (4.12%, 17/413).\n \n \n CONCLUSIONS\n NLP is in a period of robust development in the medical field, with an average of approximately 100 publications annually. Electronic medical records were the most used research materials, but social media such as Twitter have become important research materials since 2015. Cancer (24.94%, 103/413) was the most common subject area in NLP-assisted medical research on diseases, with breast cancers (23.30%, 24/103) and lung cancers (14.56%, 15/103) accounting for the highest proportions of studies. Columbia University and the talents trained therein were the most active and prolific research forces on NLP in the medical field.",

    "abstract": "Acute pharyngitis is one of the most common causes of pediatric health care visits, accounting for approximately 12 million ambulatory care visits each year. Rapid antigen detection tests (RADTs) for Group A Streptococcus (GAS) are one of the most commonly ordered tests in the ambulatory settings. Approximately 40\u201360% of RADTs are estimated to be inappropriate. Determination of inappropriate RADT frequently requires time-intensive chart reviews. The purpose of this study was to determine if natural language processing (NLP) can provide an accurate and automated alternative for assessing RADT inappropriateness.\n \n \n \n Patients \u2265 3 years of age who received an RADT while evaluated in our EDs/UCCs between April 2018 and September 2018 were identified. A manual chart review was completed on a 10% random sample to determine the presence of sore throat or viral symptoms (i.e., conjunctivitis, rhinorrhea, cough, diarrhea, hoarse voice, and viral exanthema). Inappropriate RADT was defined as either absence of sore throat or reporting 2 or more viral symptoms. An NLP algorithm was developed independently to assign the presence/absence of symptoms and RADT inappropriateness. The NLP sensitivity/specificity was calculated using the manual chart review sample as the gold standard.\n \n \n \n Manual chart review was completed on 720 patients, of which 320 (44.4%) were considered to have an inappropriate RADT. When compared to the manual review, the NLP approach showed high sensitivity (se) and specificity (sp) when assigning inappropriateness (88.4% and 90.0%, respectively). Optimal sensitivity/specificity was also observed for select symptoms, including sore throat (se: 92.9%, sp: 92.5%), cough (se: 94.5%, sp: 96.5%), and rhinorrhea (se: 86.1%, sp: 95.3%). The prevalence of clinical symptoms was similar when running NLP on subsequent, independent validation sets. After validating the NLP algorithm, a long term monthly trend report was developed.\n Figure Inappropriate GAS RADTs Determined by NLP, June 2018-May 2020\n \n \n \n \n An NLP algorithm can accurately identify inappropriate RADT when compared to a gold standard. Manual chart review requires dozens of hours to complete. In contrast, NLP requires only a couple of minutes and offers the potential to calculate valid metrics that are easily scaled-up to help monitor comprehensive, long-term trends.\n \n \n \n Brian R.

Such resources include data, time, storage, or energy, all of which are naturally limited and unevenly distributed. This motivates research into efficient methods that require fewer resources to achieve similar results. This survey synthesizes and relates current methods and findings in efficient NLP. We aim to provide both guidance for conducting NLP under limited resources, and point towards promising research directions for developing more efficient methods.",

I argue that hype and fear about GPT-3, even within the Natural Language Processing (NLP) industry and AI ethics, have often been underpinned by technologically deterministic perspectives. These perspectives emphasise the autonomy of the language model rather than the autonomy of human actors in AI systems. I highlight the existence of deterministic perspectives in the current AI discourse (which range from technological utopianism to dystopianism), with a specific focus on the\u00a0two issues of: (1) GPT-3\u2019s potential intentional misuse for manipulation and (2) unintentional harm caused by bias. In response, I find that a contextual approach to GPT-3, which is centred upon wider ecologies of societal harm and benefit, human autonomy, and human values, illuminates practical solutions to concerns about manipulation and bias. Additionally, although OpenAI\u2019s newest 2022 language model InstructGPT represents a small step in reducing toxic language and aligning GPT-3 with user intent, it does not provide any compelling solutions to manipulation or bias. Therefore, I argue that solutions to address these issues must focus on organisational settings as a precondition for ethical decision-making in AI, and high-quality curated datasets as a precondition for less harmful language model outputs.",

    "abstract": "Every year, phishing results in losses of billions of dollars and is a major threat to the Internet economy. Phishing attacks are now most often carried out by email. To better comprehend the existing research trend of phishing email detection, several review studies have been performed. However, it is important to assess this issue from different perspectives. None of the surveys have ever comprehensively studied the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for detection of phishing except one that shed light on the use of NLP techniques for classification and training purposes, while exploring a few alternatives. To bridge the gap, this study aims to systematically review and synthesise research on the use of NLP for detecting phishing emails. Based on specific predefined criteria, a total of 100 research articles published between 2006 and 2022 were identified and analysed. We study the key research areas in phishing email detection using NLP, machine learning algorithms used in phishing detection email, text features in phishing emails, datasets and resources that have been used in phishing emails, and the evaluation criteria. The findings include that the main research area in phishing detection studies is feature extraction and selection, followed by methods for classifying and optimizing the detection of phishing emails. Amongst the range of classification algorithms, support vector machines (SVMs) are heavily utilised for detecting phishing emails. The most frequently used NLP techniques are found to be TF-IDF and word embeddings. Furthermore, the most commonly used datasets for benchmarking phishing email detection methods is the Nazario phishing corpus. Also, Python is the most commonly used one for phishing email detection. It is expected that the findings of this paper can be helpful for the scientific community, especially in the field of NLP application in cybersecurity problems. This survey also is unique in the sense that it relates works to their openly available tools and resources. The analysis of the presented works revealed that not much work had been performed on Arabic language phishing emails using NLP techniques. Therefore, many open issues are associated with Arabic phishing email detection.",

Recently, the debut of ChatGPT has drawn a great deal of attention from the natural language processing (NLP) community due to the fact that it can generate high-quality responses to human input and self-correct previous mistakes based on subsequent conversations. However, it is not yet known whether ChatGPT can serve as a generalist model that can perform many NLP tasks zero-shot. In this work, we empirically analyze the zero-shot learning ability of ChatGPT by evaluating it on 20 popular NLP datasets covering 7 representative task categories. With extensive empirical studies, we demonstrate both the effectiveness and limitations of the current version of ChatGPT. We find that ChatGPT performs well on many tasks favoring reasoning capabilities (e.g., arithmetic reasoning) while it still faces challenges when solving specific tasks such as sequence tagging. We additionally provide in-depth analysis through qualitative case studies.",

This paper presents and discusses a literature review exploring how Natural Language Processing (NLP) has been applied to occurrence reports within safety-critical industries, informing further research on the topic and highlighting common challenges. Some of the uses of NLP include the ability for occurrence reports to be automatically classified against categories, and entities such as causes and consequences to be extracted from the text as well as the semantic searching of occurrence databases. The review revealed that machine learning models form the dominant method when applying NLP, although rule-based algorithms still provide a viable option for some entity extraction tasks. Recent advances in deep learning models such as Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding are now achieving a high accuracy while eliminating the need to substantially pre-process text. The construction of safety-themed datasets would be of benefit for the application of NLP to occurrence reporting, as this would allow the fine-tuning of current language models to safety tasks. An interesting approach is the use of topic modelling, which represents a shift away from the prescriptive classification taxonomies, splitting data into \u201ctopics\u201d. Where many papers focus on the computational accuracy of models, they would also benefit from real-world trials to further inform usefulness. It is anticipated that NLP will soon become a mainstream tool used by safety practitioners to efficiently process and gain knowledge from safety-related text.",

Although, most of these theories have now become obsolete, due to a better understanding of the learning process, some terminologies such as Skinner\u2019s \u201creinforcement\u201d still find their place in modern day education. Reinforcement is a broad term and involves reiteration or enhancement of learning or behavior. \nObjectives: The present study undertakes a scoping review to identify evidence showing the role of reinforcement strategies on student learning in medical education \nEligibility criteria:\u00a0 Research papers describing any teaching learning strategy or educational intervention that used Reinforcement of learning at any time during the learning process. \nSources of evidence:\u00a0Online databases were used to identify articles in the years 2009\u20132019, from which 10 publications from Canada & the United States and 6 from other nations were selected after meeting inclusion criteria. \nCharting methods: Data collected from the sources was charted with the help of a self-developed form, inclusive of Names of Authors & year of publication, type of article, country of origin, sample size, objectives & key findings of study \nResults: This scoping review shows that reinforcement strategies still have a high impact on student learning and reinforcing the taught material in medical education enhances student learning and retention. \nConclusion: Reinforcement of taught material has a positive impact on student learning in modern day medical education.",

    "abstract": "The year 2020 has seen the COVID-19 virus lead to one of the worst global pandemics in history. As a result, governments around the world are faced with the challenge of protecting public health, while keeping the economy running to the greatest extent possible. Epidemiological models provide insight into the spread of these types of diseases and predict the effects of possible intervention policies. However, to date,the even the most data-driven intervention policies rely on heuristics. In this paper, we study how reinforcement learning (RL) can be used to optimize mitigation policies that minimize the economic impact without overwhelming the hospital capacity. Our main contributions are (1) a novel agent-based pandemic simulator which, unlike traditional models, is able to model fine-grained interactions among people at specific locations in a community; and (2) an RL-based methodology for optimizing fine-grained mitigation policies within this simulator. Our results validate both the overall simulator behavior and the learned policies under realistic conditions.",

STEM-Robotics is usually implemented as an extracurricular program in many schools. In the 2019/2020 school year, Edu Global Senior High School Bandung implemented STEM-Robotics as an intra-curricular for the ten-grade science program. STEM-Robotic implementation as an intra-curricular based on the challenges of 21st-century learning that lead to innovative creative learning and skills development. The method in this study is descriptive qualitative research method through the observations, questionnaires, and interview with teacher teams. The results of this study show that, 1) The implementation of STEM-Robotic as an intra-curricular has a curriculum that focuses about robots NXT and Arduino to provide the basics of engineering and technological skills in robotics and coding, while the concepts of science and mathematics have not been directly linked in STEM-Robotic, 2) The implementation of STEM-Robotic dominated by hands-on and mind-on activities in the learning process and its assessment. 3) Generally, students responded positively to the implementation of STEM-Robotics as an intra-curricular that makes learning more interesting, useful, fun, challenging, and develop engineering and technology skills. This result indicates that STEM-Robotic is an alternative subject or learning strategy in regular curriculum to accommodate science learning with educational robotics.",

Present study to critically review the currently available evidence of studies carried out and look at the impact of humanoid robots on children, elder care, and education. Four major factors will be considered \u2013 the type of studies carried on the influence of robots on children\u2019s behavior and growth, elder care, the understanding of stakeholders (parents, children, and educators) on educational robots, and finally, the reactions of the children and elderly population on robot design or presence. This review will reveal the validating of their use of robots including experimental and non-experimental trials. The steps in this process will be conducted according to the PRISMA-P (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis Protocols) guidelines for meta-analysis. A comprehensive review of the literature search from Medline, the Cochrane Library, Scopus, PubMed, ProQuest, and secondary references will be performed from inception to April 15, 2021. Analyses will be done to calculate summary estimates on awareness indicators and test procedures by using fixed/random-effects models. Meta-regression and covariate analyses will be performed to explore the influence of confounders on the net pooled effect. Titles and abstracts will be assessed by three independent reviewers for potential relevance. Using study-specific data forms, predetermined data will be extracted for each study. Data extracted will include: 1) study characteristics, 2) study design, 3) population characteristics, 4) details of the comparison group(s), 5) awareness indicators, 6) skills development, 7) progressive, 8) outcome data, and 9) Study year. Other classifications to be considered are a type of skill and specific age.",

    "abstract": "We introduce DeepNash, an autonomous agent that plays the imperfect information game Stratego at a human expert level. Stratego is one of the few iconic board games that artificial intelligence (AI) has not yet mastered. It is a game characterized by a twin challenge: It requires long-term strategic thinking as in chess, but it also requires dealing with imperfect information as in poker. The technique underpinning DeepNash uses a game-theoretic, model-free deep reinforcement learning method, without search, that learns to master Stratego through self-play from scratch. DeepNash beat existing state-of-the-art AI methods in Stratego and achieved a year-to-date (2022) and all-time top-three ranking on the Gravon games platform, competing with human expert players. Description Machine learning to play Stratego Stratego is a popular two-player imperfect information board game. Because of its complexity stemming from its enormous game tree, decision-making under imperfect information, and a piece deployment phase at the start, Stratego poses a challenge for artificial intelligence (AI). Previous computer programs only performed at an amateur level at best. Perolat et al. introduce a model-free multiagent reinforcement learning methodology and show that it can achieve human expert\u2013level performance in Stratego. The present work not only adds to the growing list of games that AI systems can play as well or even better than humans but may also facilitate further applications of reinforcement learning methods in real-world, large-scale multiagent problems that are characterized by imperfect information and thus are currently unsolvable. \u2014YS Reinforcement learning achieves human expert\u2013level performance in the large-scale imperfect information board game Stratego.",

    "abstract": "This article provides an exposition of the field of adaptive control and its intersections with reinforcement learning. Adaptive control and reinforcement learning are two different methods that are both commonly employed for the control of uncertain systems. Historically, adaptive control has excelled at real-time control of systems with specific model structures through adaptive rules that learn the underlying parameters while providing strict guarantees on stability, asymptotic performance, and learning. Reinforcement learning methods are applicable to a broad class of systems and are able to produce near-optimal policies for highly complex control tasks. This is often enabled by significant offline training via simulation or the collection of large input-state datasets. This article attempts to compare adaptive control and reinforcement learning using a common framework. The problem statement in each field and highlights of their results are outlined. Two specific examples of dynamic systems are used to illustrate the details of the two methods, their advantages, and their deficiencies. The need for real-time control methods that leverage tools from both approaches is motivated through the lens of this common framework. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Control, Robotics, and Autonomous Systems, Volume 14 is May 2023. Please see http://www.annualreviews.org/page/journal/pubdates for revised estimates.",

    "abstract": "Learning from Demonstrations, the field that proposes to learn robot behavior models from data, is gaining popularity with the emergence of deep generative models. Although the problem has been studied for years under names such as Imitation Learning, Behavioral Cloning, or Inverse Reinforcement Learning, classical methods have relied on models that don't capture complex data distributions well or don't scale well to large numbers of demonstrations. In recent years, the robot learning community has shown increasing interest in using deep generative models to capture the complexity of large datasets. In this survey, we aim to provide a unified and comprehensive review of the last year's progress in the use of deep generative models in robotics. We present the different types of models that the community has explored, such as energy-based models, diffusion models, action value maps, or generative adversarial networks. We also present the different types of applications in which deep generative models have been used, from grasp generation to trajectory generation or cost learning. One of the most important elements of generative models is the generalization out of distributions. In our survey, we review the different decisions the community has made to improve the generalization of the learned models. Finally, we highlight the research challenges and propose a number of future directions for learning deep generative models in robotics.",

It has been unveiled by the METS analysis that miRNA/miRNA quantum programming code would control oncogenesis via the hub miRNA in the miRNA biomarker panel. While the etiologic implication between gastric cancer and Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is still not cleared, many reports have statistically supported the efficacy of eradication of H. pylori to reduce the risk of gastric cancer. Material and methods: To elucidate etiological significance of the biomarker miRNA panel in H. pylori infection, the data was firstly extracted from database to predict a feasible explanation for H. pylori pathogenicity upon cancer in the stomach. The aetiologies of gastric and oesophageal cancers, and H. pylori infection with or without vegetables and fruits were dynamically simulated by the computation using the quantum miRNA language with the METS. Statistical analysis was also performed by machine learning. Results: In the quantum network, H. pylori infection showed proton pump inhibition, and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) expression was reduced as the common factor between gastric cancer stage I and H. pylori infection; however, both were pathogenic but not seriously oncogenic. Statistically, chronic H. pylori infection itself was not be significant upon oncogenic. Conclusions: The environmental stress including mal-diets, such as long-term less fresh vegetable and fruit, would dysregulate miRNA expression, additionally it may contribute most for increasing risk of gastric cancer through enhancing glucose metabolic pathway on a paradox in Zen Buddhism riddle via IGF1R inhibition by H. pylori infection. Thus, xenotropic plant miRNAs (xenomiRNAs) from fresh vegetables and fruits may cure from paradoxical tumorigenesis with H. pylori infection. *Correspondence to: Yoichi Robertus Fujii, Kawada-Cho, 106-6, Astuta-Ku, Nagoya, Japan, Tel: +81-52-682-7003; E-mail: fatfuji@hotmail.co.jp key words: microRNA, xenomiRNA, gastric cancer, esophageal cancer, plant, food, machine learning Received: September 02, 2019; Accepted: September 20, 2019; Published: September 23, 2019 Introduction Gastric cancer and oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) have been the leading causes of cancer mortality in the world and the high incident rate in Asian with a total 5-years overall survival rate of 18-25% [1,2]. Risk factors of gastric cancer resemble those of ESCC, which are Tobacco, alcohol, chemical exposure, diet and obesity, etc. The other one of gastric cancer is associated with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection but ESCC is not. Drs. Marshall B. and Warren R. were awarded the 2005 Nobel Prize for the discovery of H. pylori, which now is the dominant risk factor of gastric cancer; however, some people in Asia has persistently infected with H. pylori infection at high rates but do not suffer from high incident rates of gastric cancer because of availability of fresh fruits and vegetables all year round [3,4]. H. pylori infection reduces the risk of oesophageal inflammation and ESCC and shows to protect against cardia gastric cancer [5,6]. Thus, although the role of booster might be statistically shown in gastric cancer development under H. pylori infection, the relation of oncogenesis between H. pylori infection and host in gastric cancer is complex. MicroRNA (miRNA) would be a quantum programming code device of lives because most of all protein genes are directly or indirectly tuned by miRNAs and it controls development, metabolism, cardiac system, neural system, immune system, infection and cancer. Highly dimensional quantum interaction of miRNA/miRNA has been correlated with context score of miRNA/mRNA the prediction tool, which is calculated by the sum of site-type specific, 3\u2019 UTR pairing, local A or U presence, and position contributions [7-9]. miRNA is circulated into the circulating system of human with stable extracellular form, such as in the exosomes, therefore, circulating miRNAs are now considered and clinically trialed as various disease biomarkers. Biomarker panel of miRNAs has been examined in diagnosis and prognosis of gastric cancer [10-13], oesophageal cancer [14-19] and H. pylori infection [10,20]. To elucidate a miRNA gene specific character of high dimension coherence in the RNA wave 2000, the ones for all and all for ones\u2019 relation between miRNAs and target mRNAs, we have previously shown the etiologic characters of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and breast, pancreatic, lung and colorectal cancers by the miRNA memory package (MMP) from the circulating miRNA panel using the miRNA entangling target sorter (METS) analysis with quantum miRNA language [21, 22].

Graph learning has been another hot field among the machine learning and data mining communities, which learns knowledge from graph-structured data. Examples of graph learning range from social network analysis such as community detection and link prediction, to relational machine learning such as knowledge graph completion and recommender systems, to mutli-graph tasks such as graph classification and graph generation etc. An emerging new field, graph deep learning, aims at applying deep learning to graphs. To deal with graph-structured data, graph neural networks (GNNs) are invented in recent years which directly take graphs as input and output graph/node representations. Although GNNs have shown superior performance than traditional methods in tasks such as semi-supervised node classification, there still exist a wide range of other important graph learning problems",

    "abstract": "OF THE DISSERTATION Kernel Methods for Graph-structured Data Analysis by Zhen Zhang Doctor of Philosophy in Electrical Engineering Washington University in St. Louis, 2019 Professor Arye Nehorai, Chair Structured data modeled as graphs arise in many application domains, such as computer vision, bioinformatics, and sociology. In this dissertation, we focus on three important topics in graph-structured data analysis: graph comparison, graph embeddings, and graph matching, for all of which we propose effective algorithms by making use of kernel functions and the corresponding reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. For the first topic, we develop effective graph kernels, named as \u201cRetGK,\u201d for quantitatively measuring the similarities between graphs. Graph kernels, which are positive definite functions on graphs, are powerful similarity measures, in the sense that they make various kernel-based learning algorithms, for example, clustering, classification, and regression, applicable to structured data. Our graph kernels are obtained by two-step embeddings. In the first step, we represent the graph nodes with numerical vectors in Euclidean spaces. To do this, we revisit the concept of random walks and introduce a new node structural role descriptor, the return probability feature. In the second step, we represent the whole graph xi with an element in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. After that, we can naturally obtain our graph kernels. The advantages of our proposed kernels are that they can effectively exploit various node attributes, while being scalable to large graphs. We conduct extensive graph classification experiments to evaluate our graph kernels. The experimental results show that our graph kernels significantly outperform state-of-the-art approaches in both accuracy and computational efficiency. For the second topic, we develop scalable attributed graph embeddings, named as \u201cSAGE.\u201d Graph embeddings are Euclidean vector representations, which encode the attributed and the topological information. With graph embeddings, we can apply all the machine learning algorithms, such as neural networks, regression/classification trees, and generalized linear regression models, to graph-structured data. We also want to highlight that SAGE considers both the edge attributes and node attributes, while RetGK only considers the node attributes. \u201cSAGE\u201d is a extended work of \u201cRetGK,\u201d in the sense that it is still based on the return probabilities of random walks and is derived from graph kernels. But \u201cSAGE\u201d uses a totally different strategy, i.e., the \u201cdistance to kernel and embeddings\u201d algorithm, to further represent graphs. To involve the edge attributes, we introduce the adjoint graph, which can help convert edge attributes to node attributes. We conduct classification experiments on graphs with both node and edge attributes. \u201cSAGE\u201d achieves the better performances than all previous methods. For the third topic, we develop a new algorithm, named as \u201cKerGM,\u201d for graph matching. Typically, graph matching problems can be formulated as two kinds of quadratic assignment problems (QAPs): Koopmans-Beckmann\u2019s QAP or Lawler\u2019s QAP. In our work, we",

    "abstract": "The year 2020 has been defined \u201cthe second year of the MOOC\u201d. In the last year many changes happened in the world of e-learning, mainly due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the subsequent measures adopted on a global scale. Therefore, it is not surprising that we are attending to a rising interest in MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses), even from a critical point of view. In this scenario, LMOOCs are constantly gaining popularity, so there is a need for new perspectives, that should allow to study the language teaching and learning in massive contexts, considering these contexts as complex systems. This paper aims to analyse Introduction to Italian (Universita per Stranieri di Siena), a linguistic MOOC hosted by FutureLearn, from a social network analysis point of view. Moreover, the LMOOC is investigated by means of a series of directed and weighted graphs, in which every user is a node that, when interacting with another user, builds an edge . The study investigates the communicative relationships represented by the graphs, calculating the betweenness centrality values and relating them with learners\u2019 performances. Results give on one hand the chance to reflect upon the importance, for learners, to participate in the conversations that take place inside the LMOOC; on the other hand, data allow to consider the role of tutors as facilitators in building and maintaining a positive and effective learning environment.",

    "abstract": "Mathematics learning during the COVID-19 pandemic was initially carried out online or based on a network (online). However, as time goes by where the spread of COVID-19 is getting smaller, mathematics learning is carried out face-to-face directly by paying attention to health protocols called offline or off-network-based learning. Therefore, teachers need to know the current student's learning motivation which is taught off-network-based learning. Therefore, an analysis of student motivation in off-network-based creative mathematics learning was carried out by giving a questionnaire to the seventh-grade students of SMP Dharma Wanita Medan, amounting to 27 people as research subjects. This research was conducted in the odd semester of the 2021/2022 Academic Year. While the object of this research is student learning motivation with six indicators, namely responsibility, trying to excel, liking challenges, independence, fortitude, and tenacity. This research is a qualitative-research with descriptive method. The results of this study stated that students' motivation in off-network-based creative mathematics learning was good.",

    "abstract": "Open-set domain adaptation (OSDA) aims to transfer knowledge from a label-rich source domain to a label-scarce target domain while addressing disturbances from irrelevant target classes not present in the source data. However, most OSDA approaches are limited due to the lack of essential theoretical analysis of generalization bound, reliance on the coexistence of source and target data during adaptation, and failure to accurately estimate model predictions' uncertainty. To address these limitations, the Progressive Graph Learning (PGL) framework is proposed. PGL decomposes the target hypothesis space into shared and unknown subspaces and progressively pseudo-labels the most confident known samples from the target domain for hypothesis adaptation. PGL guarantees a tight upper bound of the target error by integrating a graph neural network with episodic training and leveraging adversarial learning to close the gap between the source and target distributions. The proposed approach also tackles a more realistic source-free open-set domain adaptation (SF-OSDA) setting that makes no assumptions about the coexistence of source and target domains. In a two-stage framework, the SF-PGL model' uniformly selects the most confident target instances from each category at a fixed ratio, and the confidence thresholds in each class weigh the classification loss in the adaptation step. The proposed methods are evaluated on benchmark image classification and action recognition datasets, where they demonstrate superiority and flexibility in recognizing both shared and unknown categories. Additionally, balanced pseudo-labeling plays a significant role in improving calibration, making the trained model less prone to over- or under-confident predictions on the target data.",

    "abstract": "Recently, brain networks have been widely adopted to study brain dynamics, brain development, and brain diseases. Graph representation learning techniques on brain functional networks can facilitate the discovery of novel biomarkers for clinical phenotypes and neurodegenerative diseases. However, current graph learning techniques have several issues on brain network mining. First, most current graph learning models are designed for unsigned graph, which hinders the analysis of many signed network data (e.g., brain functional networks). Meanwhile, the insufficiency of brain network data limits the model performance on clinical phenotypes\u2019 predictions. Moreover, few of the current graph learning models are interpretable, which may not be capable of providing biological insights for model outcomes. Here, we propose an interpretable hierarchical signed graph representation learning (HSGPL) model to extract graph-level representations from brain functional networks, which can be used for different prediction tasks. To further improve the model performance, we also propose a new strategy to augment functional brain network data for contrastive learning. We evaluate this framework on different classification and regression tasks using data from human connectome project (HCP) and open access series of imaging studies (OASIS). Our results from extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model compared with several state-of-the-art techniques. In addition, we use graph saliency maps, derived from these prediction tasks, to demonstrate detection and interpretation of phenotypic biomarkers.",

    "abstract": "View-based approach that recognizes 3D shape through its projected 2D images has achieved state-of-the-art results for 3D shape recognition. The major challenges are how to aggregate multi-view features and deal with 3D shapes in arbitrary poses. We propose two versions of a novel view-based Graph Convolutional Network, dubbed view-GCN and view-GCN++, to recognize 3D shape based on graph representation of multiple views. We first construct view-graph with multiple views as graph nodes, then design two graph convolutional networks over the view-graph to hierarchically learn discriminative shape descriptor considering relations of multiple views. Specifically, view-GCN is a hierarchical network based on two pivotal operations, i.e., feature transform based on local positional and non-local graph convolution, and graph coarsening based on a selective view-sampling operation. To deal with rotation sensitivity, we further propose view-GCN++ with local attentional graph convolution operation and rotation robust view-sampling operation for graph coarsening. By these designs, view-GCN++ achieves invariance to transformations under the finite subgroup of rotation group SO(3). Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets (i.e., ModelNet40, ScanObjectNN, RGBD and ShapeNet Core55) show that view-GCN and view-GCN++ achieve state-of-the-art results for 3D shape classification and retrieval tasks under aligned and rotated settings.",

    "abstract": "Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has become one of the most common imaging modalities for brain function analysis. Recently, graph neural networks (GNN) have been adopted for fMRI analysis with superior performance. Unfortunately, traditional functional brain networks are mainly constructed based on similarities among region of interests (ROI), which are noisy and agnostic to the downstream prediction tasks and can lead to inferior results for GNN-based models. To better adapt GNNs for fMRI analysis, we propose TBDS, an end-to-end framework based on Task-aware Brain connectivity DAG (short for Directed Acyclic Graph) Structure generation for fMRI analysis. The key component of TBDS is the brain network generator which adopts a DAG learning approach to transform the raw time-series into task-aware brain connectivities. Besides, we design an additional contrastive regularization to inject task-specific knowledge during the brain network generation process. Comprehensive experiments on two fMRI datasets, namely Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) and Philadelphia Neuroimaging Cohort (PNC) datasets demonstrate the efficacy of TBDS. In addition, the generated brain networks also highlight the prediction-related brain regions and thus provide unique interpretations of the prediction results. Our implementation will be published upon acceptance.",

    "abstract": "Fake news on social media is increasingly regarded as one of the most concerning issues. Low cost, simple accessibility via social platforms, and a plethora of low-budget online news sources are some of the factors that contribute to the spread of false news. Most of the existing fake news detection algorithms are solely focused on the news content only but engaged users' prior posts or social activities provide a wealth of information about their views on news and have significant ability to improve fake news identification. Graph Neural Networks are a form of deep learning approach that conducts prediction on graph-described data. Social media platforms are followed graph structure in their representation, Graph Neural Network are special types of neural networks that could be usually applied to graphs, making it much easier to execute edge, node and graph-level prediction. Therefore, in this paper, we present a comparative analysis among some commonly used machine learning algorithms and Graph Neural Networks for detecting the spread of false news on social media platforms. In this study, we take the UPFD dataset and implement several existing machine learning algorithms on text data only. Besides this, we create different GNN layers for fusing graph-structured news propagation data and the text data as the node feature in our GNN models. GNNs provide the best solutions to the dilemma of identifying false news in our research.",

Recent advances in neuroscience and neuroimaging analysis have shown a growing interest in the interactions between brain regions of interest (ROIs) and their impact on neural development and disorder diagnosis. As a powerful deep model for analyzing graph-structured data, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been applied for brain network analysis. However, training deep models requires large amounts of labeled data, which is often scarce in brain network datasets due to the complexities of data acquisition and sharing restrictions. To make the most out of available training data, we propose PTGB, a GNN pre-training framework that captures intrinsic brain network structures, regardless of clinical outcomes, and is easily adaptable to various downstream tasks. PTGB comprises two key components: (1) an unsupervised pre-training technique designed specifically for brain networks, which enables learning from large-scale datasets without task-specific labels; (2) a data-driven parcellation atlas mapping pipeline that facilitates knowledge transfer across datasets with different ROI systems. Extensive evaluations using various GNN models have demonstrated the robust and superior performance of PTGB compared to baseline methods.",

    "abstract": "AI-driven approaches are widely used in drug discovery, where candidate molecules are generated and tested on a target protein for binding affinity prediction. However, generating new compounds with desirable molecular properties such as Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness (QED) and Dopamine Receptor D2 activity (DRD2) while adhering to distinct chemical laws is challenging. To address these challenges, we proposed a graph-based deep learning framework to generate potential therapeutic drugs targeting the SARS-CoV-2 protein. Our proposed framework consists of two modules: a novel reinforcement learning (RL)-based graph generative module with knowledge graph (KG) and a graph early fusion approach (GEFA) for binding affinity prediction. The first module uses a gated graph neural network (GGNN) model under the RL environment for generating novel molecular compounds with desired properties and a custom-made KG for molecule screening. The second module uses GEFA to predict binding affinity scores between the generated compounds and target proteins. Experiments show how fine-tuning the GGNN model under the RL environment enhances the molecules with desired properties to generate $$100\\%$$ 100 % valid and $$100\\%$$ 100 % unique compounds using different scoring functions. Additionally, KG-based screening reduces the search space of generated candidate molecules by $$96.64\\%$$ 96.64 % while retaining $$95.38\\%$$ 95.38 % of promising binding molecules against SARS-CoV-2 protein, i.e., 3C-like protease (3CLpro). We achieved a binding affinity score of 8.185 from the top rank of generated compound. In addition, we compared top-ranked generated compounds to Indinavir on different parameters, including drug-likeness and medicinal chemistry, for qualitative analysis from a drug development perspective.",

    "abstract": "Brain network analysis plays an increasingly important role in studying brain function and the exploring of disease mechanisms. However, existing brain network construction tools have some limitations, including dependency on empirical users, weak consistency in repeated experiments and time-consuming processes. In this work, a diffusion-based brain network pipeline, DGCL is designed for end-to-end construction of brain networks. Initially, the brain region-aware module (BRAM) precisely determines the spatial locations of brain regions by the diffusion process, avoiding subjective parameter selection. Subsequently, DGCL employs graph contrastive learning to optimize brain connections by eliminating individual differences in redundant connections unrelated to diseases, thereby enhancing the consistency of brain networks within the same group. Finally, the node-graph contrastive loss and classification loss jointly constrain the learning process of the model to obtain the reconstructed brain network, which is then used to analyze important brain connections. Validation on two datasets, ADNI and ABIDE, demonstrates that DGCL surpasses traditional methods and other deep learning models in predicting disease development stages. Significantly, the proposed model improves the efficiency and generalization of brain network construction. In summary, the proposed DGCL can be served as a universal brain network construction scheme, which can effectively identify important brain connections through generative paradigms and has the potential to provide disease interpretability support for neuroscience research.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel learning analytics method: Transition Network Analysis (TNA), a method that integrates Stochastic Process Mining and probabilistic graph representation to model, visualize, and identify transition patterns in the learning process data. Combining the relational and temporal aspects into a single lens offers capabilities beyond either framework, including centralities to capture important learning events, community detection to identify behavior patterns, and clustering to reveal temporal patterns. Furthermore, TNA introduces several significance tests that go beyond either method and add rigor to the analysis. Here, we introduce the theoretical and mathematical foundations of TNA and we demonstrate the functionalities of TNA with a case study where students (n=191) engaged in small-group collaboration to map patterns of group dynamics using the theories of co-regulation and socially-shared regulated learning. The analysis revealed that TNA can map the regulatory processes as well as identify important events, patterns, and clusters. Bootstrap validation established the significant transitions and eliminated spurious transitions. As such, TNA can capture learning dynamics and provide a robust framework for investigating the temporal evolution of learning processes. Future directions include \u2014inter alia\u2014 expanding estimation methods, reliability assessment, and building longitudinal TNA.",

Unlike extant research, our study focuses on students\u2019 interactions with alma mater classmates, reconstructing their complete network, tracing the impact of individual students\u2019 positions in the social graph using centrality metrics, and incorporating a developmental perspective with three measurement points. Objective proficiency gains were influenced by predeparture proficiency (negatively), multilingualism, perceived integration of the peer learner group (negatively), and the number of fellow learners speaking to the student. Analyses reveal relatively stable same\u2010gender cliques, but with changes in the patterns and strength of interaction. We also discuss interesting divergent trajectories of centrality metrics, L2 use, and progress; predictors of self\u2010perceived progress across skills; and the interplay of context and gender.",

    "abstract": "ENHANCING PORTABILITY IN HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTING: DESIGNING FAST SCIENTIFIC CODE WITH LONGEVITY Jason Orender Old Dominion University, 2019 Director: Dr. Mohommed Zubair Portability, an oftentimes sought-after goal in scientific applications, confers a number of possible advantages onto computer code. Portable code will often have greater longevity, enjoy a broader ecosystem, appeal to a wider variety of application developers, and by definition will run on more systems than its pigeonholed counterpart. These advantages come at a cost, however, and a rational approach to balancing costs and benefits requires a systemic evaluation. While the benefits for each application are likely situation-dependent, the costs in terms of resources, including but not limited to time, money, computational power, and memory requirements, are quantifiable. This document will identify strategies for enhancing performance portability on a variety of platforms available to the scientific computing community which will have little or no adverse impact on alternate architectures; this is done by implementing an iterative point solver requiring a high degree of data transfer bandwidth of a type commonly used in high performance applications used for computing a solution to partial di\u21b5erential equations (PDEs). In this thesis, we were able to show significant speed enhancements for architectures as diverse as complex traditional Central Processing Units (CPUs), Graphical Processing Units (GPUs), and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). Employing generalized optimizations on a variety of development frameworks we were able to show as much as a 92.5% reduction on a pipelined architecture (FPGA) while having a negligible impact on alternate architectures, and an 88.6% reduction in execution time on a Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) architecture (GPU/CPU) while also having a negligible impact on alternate architectures. By enforcing these design rules in released versions of scientific code, the code has the potential to be optimally positioned for future advancements in computing architecture as well as being performance portable among existing architectures.",

Building on a deployment in a multi-cloud environment, where dCache acts as a write-through and read-through cache with one single, distributed namespace, we introduce the reader to dCache storage events in both tracks: message queuing and server sent events. Turning to broader use case scenarios in cloud native applications, we address the role of dCache in the EOSCpilot project \"Photon and Neutron Science Demonstrator\", a deployment of Function-as-a-Service platforms for both, interactive and event-driven scientific computing",

    "abstract": "Up-to-date cancer burden indicators are essential to support political decision making, to enable epidemiological research and as an information source for citizens. Nevertheless, observed cancer incidence and mortality suffer from an endemic registration delay in the data production workflow. To overcome this, the European Commission's Joint Research Centre in collaboration with the WHO's International Agency for Research on Cancer have computed estimates of cancer incidence and mortality, for the year 2020 and for European countries, in the framework of the European Cancer Information System (ECIS).\n \n \n \n Predicted values for the year 2020 are based on the incidence data of more than 150 European population-based cancer registries included in the ECIS, and on the WHO mortality database. According to previously developed and applied methodology, the estimates of 2020 cancer incidence and mortality rates were produced for 40 European countries, on the basis of the most recent time trends of observed data, where possible. Estimated rates were then applied to the projected 2020 population from EUROSTAT, to calculate the predicted number of new cases and deaths for 2020 in each European country.\n \n \n \n The number of new cancer cases and deaths in 2020 has been estimated per country by sex and age group, for 25 major cancer sites. The results are included and disseminated through the ECIS web application (https://ecis.jrc.ec.europa.eu/).\n \n \n \n The release of up-to-date cancer incidence and mortality estimates is of crucial importance in supporting evidence-based EU cancer policies. The homogeneity of the estimation methods applied throughout Europe guarantees the comparability of the estimated values between countries. Reliable and comparable estimates enable highlighting differences between countries in cancer incidence and mortality, thus facilitating the identification of possible intervention areas.\n \n \n \n The EC\u2019s JRC, in collaboration with WHO\u2019s IARC, have computed estimates of cancer incidence and mortality for the year 2020 for European countries, in the framework of the ECIS. The number of new cancer cases and deaths in 2020 has been estimated in 40 European countries for 25 major cancer sites and included in the ECIS web application (https://ecis.jrc.ec.europa.eu/).",

    "abstract": "Qubit by Qubit\u2019s Quantum Computing Summer School is a four-week summer course for high school and university students in their first or second year of studies. The aim of the summer school is to introduce the field of Quantum Information Sciences and Engineering (QISE), specifically quantum computing. Through the course, students learn about quantum mechanics, quantum computation and information (quantum gates, circuits, and algorithms and protocols, including Grover\u2019s Algorithm and Quantum Key Distribution), applications of quantum computing, and quantum hardware. Students also learn how to program in Qiskit and basic mathematics for quantum, including matrices and vectors. The Quantum Computing Summer School program enrolled a diverse population of high school and undergraduate students with 48% of participants identifying at female or non-binary, 20% of students identifying as Hispanic, 17% identifying as Black, and 38% identifying as Asian. The program substantially increased participants\u2019 knowledge about quantum computing, as exhibited by large gains on a technical assessment that was administered at the beginning and end of the program. On a survey of student motivation, students in the program showed a statistically significant increase in their expectancy of being successful in quantum computing and valuing quantum computing. From the beginning of the program to the end of the program, there was a statistically significant increase in students\u2019 reported sense of belonging in quantum. Participation in the program increased students\u2019 interest in pursuing additional coursework and careers in STEM generally and in quantum specifically.",

    "abstract": "Multicriteria methods have gained traction in academia and industry practices for effective decision-making. This systematic review investigates and presents an overview of multi-criteria approaches research conducted over forty-four years. The Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus databases were searched for papers on multi-criteria methods with titles, abstracts, keywords, and articles from January 1977 to 29 April 2022. Using the R Bibliometrix tool, the bibliographic data was evaluated. According to this bibliometric analysis, in 131 countries over the past forty-four years, 33,201 authors have written 23,494 documents on multi-criteria methods. This area\u2019s scientific output increases by 14.18 percent every year. China has the highest percentage of publications at 18.50 percent, followed by India at 10.62 percent and Iran at 7.75 percent. Islamic Azad University has the most publications with 504, followed by Vilnius Gediminas Technical University with 456 and the National Institute of Technology with 336. Expert Systems With Applications, Sustainability, and the Journal of Cleaner Production are the top journals, accounting for over 4.67 percent of all indexed works. In addition, E. Zavadskas and J. Wang have the most papers in the multi-criteria approaches sector. AHP, followed by TOPSIS, VIKOR, PROMETHEE, and ANP, is the most popular multi-criteria decision-making method among the ten nations with the most publications in this field. The bibliometric literature review method enables researchers to investigate the multi-criteria research area in greater depth than the conventional literature review method. It allows a vast dataset of bibliographic records to be statistically and systematically evaluated, producing insightful insights. This bibliometric study is helpful because it provides an overview of the issue of multi-criteria techniques from the past forty-four years, allowing other academics to use this research as a starting point for their studies.",

Ekimov in 1981, the interest of researchers in that particular type of nanomaterials (NMs) with unique optical and electrical properties has been increasing year by year. Thus, since 2009, the number of scientific articles published on this topic has not been less than a thousand a year. The increasing use of QDs due to their biomedical, pharmaceutical, biological, photovoltaics or computing applications, as well as many other high-tech uses such as for displays and solid-state lighting (SSL), has given rise to a considerable number of studies about its potential toxicity. However, there are a really low number of reported studies on the detection and quantification of QDs, and these include ICP\u2013MS and electrochemical analysis, which are the most common quantification techniques employed for this purpose. The knowledge of chemical phenomena occurring on the surface of QDs is crucial for understanding the interactions of QDs with species dissolved in the dispersion medium, while it paves the way for a widespread use of chemosensors to facilitate its detection. Keeping in mind both human health and environmental risks of QDs as well as the scarcity of analytical techniques and methodological approaches for their detection, the adaptation of existing techniques and methods used with other NMs appears necessary. In order to provide a multidisciplinary perspective on QD detection, this review focused on three interrelated key aspects of QDs: properties, surface chemistry and detection.",

To address the growing need for increased storage capacity, lower access latency, and higher bandwidth, emerging technologies such as non-volatile memory are integrated into supercomputer I/O subsystems. With these emerging trends, we need a better understanding of the multilayer supercomputer I/O systems and ways to use these subsystems efficiently. In this work, we study the I/O access patterns and performance characteristics of two representative supercomputer I/O subsystems. Through an extensive analysis of year-long I/O logs on each system, we report new observations in I/O reads and writes, unbalanced use of storage system layers, and new trends in user behaviors at the HPC I/O middleware stack.",

    "abstract": "Meteor showers and their outbursts are the dominant source of meteoroid impact risk to spacecraft on short time scales. Meteor shower prediction models depend on historical observations to produce accurate forecasts. However, the current lack of quality and persistent world-wide monitoring at optical meteoroid sizes has left some recent major outbursts poorly observed. A novel method of computing meteor shower flux is developed and applied to Global Meteor Network data. The method is verified against previously published observations of the Perseids and the Geminids. The complete mathematical and algorithmic details of computing meteor shower fluxes from video observations are described. As an example application of our approach, the flux measurements of the 2021 Perseid outburst, the 2020-2022 Quadrantids, and 2020-2021 Geminids are presented. The flux of the 2021 Perseids reached similar levels to the 1991-1994 and 2016 outbursts (ZHR \u223c 280). The flux of the Quadrantids shows high year-to-year variability in the core of the stream while the longer lasting background activity is less variable, consistent with an age difference between the two components. The Geminids show a double peak in flux near the time of peak.",

Intuitive Surgical is committed to fostering these changes and the machine learning models and algorithms that will enable them. With these goals in mind we have invited the surgical data science community to participate in a yearly competition hosted through the Medical Imaging Computing and Computer Assisted Interventions (MICCAI) conference. With varying changes from year to year, we have challenged the community to solve difficult machine learning problems in the context of advanced RA applications. Here we document the results of these challenges, focusing on surgical tool localization (SurgToolLoc). The publicly released dataset that accompanies these challenges is detailed in a separate paper arXiv:2501.09209 [1].",

    "title": "EfficientNet: Rethinking Model Scaling for Convolutional Neural Networks",
    "abstract": "Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) are commonly developed at a fixed resource budget, and then scaled up for better accuracy if more resources are available. In this paper, we systematically study model scaling and identify that carefully balancing network depth, width, and resolution can lead to better performance. Based on this observation, we propose a new scaling method that uniformly scales all dimensions of depth/width/resolution using a simple yet highly effective compound coefficient. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on scaling up MobileNets and ResNet. \nTo go even further, we use neural architecture search to design a new baseline network and scale it up to obtain a family of models, called EfficientNets, which achieve much better accuracy and efficiency than previous ConvNets. In particular, our EfficientNet-B7 achieves state-of-the-art 84.4% top-1 / 97.1% top-5 accuracy on ImageNet, while being 8.4x smaller and 6.1x faster on inference than the best existing ConvNet. Our EfficientNets also transfer well and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on CIFAR-100 (91.7%), Flowers (98.8%), and 3 other transfer learning datasets, with an order of magnitude fewer parameters.

    "abstract": "Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a special type of Neural Networks, which has shown exemplary performance on several competitions related to Computer Vision and Image Processing. Some of the exciting application areas of CNN include Image Classification and Segmentation, Object Detection, Video Processing, Natural Language Processing, and Speech Recognition. The powerful learning ability of deep CNN is primarily due to the use of multiple feature extraction stages that can automatically learn representations from the data. The availability of a large amount of data and improvement in the hardware technology has accelerated the research in CNNs, and recently interesting deep CNN architectures have been reported. Several inspiring ideas to bring advancements in CNNs have been explored, such as the use of different activation and loss functions, parameter optimization, regularization, and architectural innovations. However, the significant improvement in the representational capacity of the deep CNN is achieved through architectural innovations. Notably, the ideas of exploiting spatial and channel information, depth and width of architecture, and multi-path information processing have gained substantial attention. Similarly, the idea of using a block of layers as a structural unit is also gaining popularity. This survey thus focuses on the intrinsic taxonomy present in the recently reported deep CNN architectures and, consequently, classifies the recent innovations in CNN architectures into seven different categories. These seven categories are based on spatial exploitation, depth, multi-path, width, feature-map exploitation, channel boosting, and attention. Additionally, the elementary understanding of CNN components, current challenges, and applications of CNN are also provided.",

    "abstract": "Point cloud analysis is very challenging, as the shape implied in irregular points is difficult to capture. In this paper, we propose RS-CNN, namely, Relation-Shape Convolutional Neural Network, which extends regular grid CNN to irregular configuration for point cloud analysis. The key to RS-CNN is learning from relation, i.e., the geometric topology constraint among points. Specifically, the convolutional weight for local point set is forced to learn a high-level relation expression from predefined geometric priors, between a sampled point from this point set and the others. In this way, an inductive local representation with explicit reasoning about the spatial layout of points can be obtained, which leads to much shape awareness and robustness. With this convolution as a basic operator, RS-CNN, a hierarchical architecture can be developed to achieve contextual shape-aware learning for point cloud analysis. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks across three tasks verify RS-CNN achieves the state of the arts.",

    "abstract": "Medical image classification plays an essential role in clinical treatment and teaching tasks. However, the traditional method has reached its ceiling on performance. Moreover, by using them, much time and effort need to be spent on extracting and selecting classification features. The deep neural network is an emerging machine learning method that has proven its potential for different classification tasks. Notably, the convolutional neural network dominates with the best results on varying image classification tasks. However, medical image datasets are hard to collect because it needs a lot of professional expertise to label them. Therefore, this paper researches how to apply the convolutional neural network (CNN) based algorithm on a chest X-ray dataset to classify pneumonia. Three techniques are evaluated through experiments. These are linear support vector machine classifier with local rotation and orientation free features, transfer learning on two convolutional neural network models: Visual Geometry Group i.e., VGG16 and InceptionV3, and a capsule network training from scratch. Data augmentation is a data preprocessing method applied to all three methods. The results of the experiments show that data augmentation generally is an effective way for all three algorithms to improve performance. Also, Transfer learning is a more useful classification method on a small dataset compared to a support vector machine with oriented fast and rotated binary (ORB) robust independent elementary features and capsule network. In transfer learning, retraining specific features on a new target dataset is essential to improve performance. And, the second important factor is a proper network complexity that matches the scale of the dataset.",

    "abstract": "Computer vision has achieved great success using standardized image representations -- pixel arrays, and the corresponding deep learning operators -- convolutions. In this work, we challenge this paradigm: we instead (a) represent images as a set of visual tokens and (b) apply visual transformers to find relationships between visual semantic concepts. Given an input image, we dynamically extract a set of visual tokens from the image to obtain a compact representation for high-level semantics. We then use visual transformers to operate over the visual tokens to densely model relationships between them. We find that this paradigm of token-based image representation and processing drastically outperforms its convolutional counterparts on image classification and semantic segmentation. To demonstrate the power of this approach on ImageNet classification, we use ResNet as a convenient baseline and use visual transformers to replace the last stage of convolutions. This reduces the stage's MACs by up to 6.9x, while attaining up to 4.53 points higher top-1 accuracy. For semantic segmentation, we use a visual-transformer-based FPN (VT-FPN) module to replace a convolution-based FPN, saving 6.5x fewer MACs while achieving up to 0.35 points higher mIoU on LIP and COCO-stuff.",

    "abstract": "Structural health monitoring at local and global levels using computer vision technologies has gained much attention in the structural health monitoring community in research and practice. Due to the computer vision technology application advantages such as non-contact, long distance, rapid, low cost and labor, and low interference to the daily operation of structures, it is promising to consider computer vision\u2013structural health monitoring as a complement to the conventional structural health monitoring. This article presents a general overview of the concepts, approaches, and real-life practice of computer vision\u2013structural health monitoring along with some relevant literature that is rapidly accumulating. The computer vision\u2013structural health monitoring covered in this article at local level includes applications such as crack, spalling, delamination, rust, and loose bolt detection. At the global level, applications include displacement measurement, structural behavior analysis, vibration serviceability, modal identification, model updating, damage detection, cable force monitoring, load factor estimation, and structural identification using input\u2013output information. The current research studies and applications of computer vision\u2013structural health monitoring mainly focus on the implementation and integration of two-dimensional computer vision techniques to solve structural health monitoring problems and the projective geometry methods implemented are utilized to convert the three-dimensional problems into two-dimensional problems. This review mainly puts emphasis on two-dimensional computer vision\u2013structural health monitoring applications. Subsequently, a brief review of representative developments of three-dimensional computer vision in the area of civil engineering is presented along with the challenges and opportunities of two-dimensional and three-dimensional computer vision\u2013structural health monitoring. Finally, the article presents a forward look to the future of computer vision\u2013structural health monitoring.",

This paper focuses on a review of the literature on hand gesture techniques and introduces their merits and limitations under different circumstances. In addition, it tabulates the performance of these methods, focusing on computer vision techniques that deal with the similarity and difference points, technique of hand segmentation used, classification algorithms and drawbacks, number and types of gestures, dataset used, detection range (distance) and type of camera used.

We then use the census to help hand-curate a look-up-table of images in the ImageNet-ILSVRC-2012 dataset that fall into the categories of verifiably pornographic: shot in a non-consensual setting (up-skirt), beach voyeuristic, and exposed private parts. We survey the landscape of harm and threats both the society at large and individuals face due to uncritical and ill-considered dataset curation practices. We then propose possible courses of correction and critique their pros and cons. We have duly open-sourced all of the code and the census meta-datasets generated in this endeavor for the computer vision community to build on. By unveiling the severity of the threats, our hope is to motivate the constitution of mandatory Institutional Review Boards (IRB) for large scale dataset curation.",

    "abstract": "The present work aims to explore the performance of fuzzy system-based medical image processing for predicting the brain disease. The imaging mechanism of NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) and the complexity of human brain tissues cause the brain MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) images to present varying degrees of noise, weak boundaries, and artifacts. Hence, improvements are made over the fuzzy clustering algorithm. A brain image processing and brain disease diagnosis prediction model is designed based on improved fuzzy clustering and HPU-Net (Hybrid Pyramid U-Net Model for Brain Tumor Segmentation) to ensure the model safety performance. Brain MRI images collected from a Hospital, are employed in simulation experiments to validate the performance of the proposed algorithm. Moreover, CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), RNN (Recurrent Neural Network), FCM (Fuzzy C-Means), LDCFCM (Local Density Clustering Fuzzy C-Means), and AFCM (Adaptive Fuzzy C-Means) are included in simulation experiments for performance comparison. Results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has more nodes, lower energy consumption, and more stable changes than other models under the same conditions. Regarding the overall network performance, the proposed algorithm can complete the data transmission tasks the fastest, basically maintaining at about 4.5 s on average, which performs remarkably better than other models. A further prediction performance analysis reveals that the proposed algorithm provides the highest prediction accuracy for the Whole Tumor under DSC (Dice Similarity Coefficient), reaching 0.936. Besides, its Jaccard coefficient is 0.845, proving its superior segmentation accuracy over other models. In a word, the proposed algorithm can provide higher accuracy, a more apparent denoising effect, and the best segmentation and recognition effect than other models while ensuring energy consumption. The results can provide an experimental basis for the feature recognition and predictive diagnosis of brain images.",

Perceptual datasets gathered for this purpose have provided useful benchmarks for improving IQA methods, but their heavy use creates a risk of overfitting. Here, we perform a large-scale comparison of IQA models in terms of their use as objectives for the optimization of image processing algorithms. Specifically, we use eleven full-reference IQA models to train deep neural networks for four low-level vision tasks: denoising, deblurring, super-resolution, and compression. Subjective testing on the optimized images allows us to rank the competing models in terms of their perceptual performance, elucidate their relative advantages and disadvantages in these tasks, and propose a set of desirable properties for incorporation into future IQA models.",

    "title": "Weed Identification Using Deep Learning and Image Processing in Vegetable Plantation",
    "abstract": "Weed identification in vegetable plantation is more challenging than crop weed identification due to their random plant spacing. So far, little work has been found on identifying weeds in vegetable plantation. Traditional methods of crop weed identification used to be mainly focused on identifying weed directly; however, there is a large variation in weed species. This paper proposes a new method in a contrary way, which combines deep learning and image processing technology. Firstly, a trained CenterNet model was used to detect vegetables and draw bounding boxes around them. Afterwards, the remaining green objects falling out of bounding boxes were considered as weeds. In this way, the model focuses on identifying only the vegetables and thus avoid handling various weed species. Furthermore, this strategy can largely reduce the size of training image dataset as well as the complexity of weed detection, thereby enhancing the weed identification performance and accuracy. To extract weeds from the background, a color index-based segmentation was performed utilizing image processing. The employed color index was determined and evaluated through Genetic Algorithms (GAs) according to Bayesian classification error. During the field test, the trained CenterNet model achieved a precision of 95.6%, a recall of 95.0%, and a $F_{1}$ score of 0.953, respectively. The proposed index \u221219R + 24G \u22122B \u2265 862 yields high segmentation quality with a much lower computational cost compared to the wildly used ExG index. These experiment results demonstrate the feasibility of using the proposed method for the ground-based weed identification in vegetable plantation.",

    "title": "Common Limitations of Image Processing Metrics: A Picture Story",
    "abstract": "While the importance of automatic image analysis is continuously increasing, recent meta-research revealed major flaws with respect to algorithm validation. Performance metrics are particularly key for meaningful, objective, and transparent performance assessment and validation of the used automatic algorithms, but relatively little attention has been given to the practical pitfalls when using specific metrics for a given image analysis task. These are typically related to (1) the disregard of inherent metric properties, such as the behaviour in the presence of class imbalance or small target structures, (2) the disregard of inherent data set properties, such as the non-independence of the test cases, and (3) the disregard of the actual biomedical domain interest that the metrics should reflect. This living dynamically document has the purpose to illustrate important limitations of performance metrics commonly applied in the field of image analysis. In this context, it focuses on biomedical image analysis problems that can be phrased as image-level classification, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, or object detection task. The current version is based on a Delphi process on metrics conducted by an international consortium of image analysis experts from more than 60 institutions worldwide.",

    "title": "Effect of Attention Mechanism in Deep Learning-Based Remote Sensing Image Processing: A Systematic Literature Review",
    "abstract": "Machine learning, particularly deep learning (DL), has become a central and state-of-the-art method for several computer vision applications and remote sensing (RS) image processing. Researchers are continually trying to improve the performance of the DL methods by developing new architectural designs of the networks and/or developing new techniques, such as attention mechanisms. Since the attention mechanism has been proposed, regardless of its type, it has been increasingly used for diverse RS applications to improve the performances of the existing DL methods. However, these methods are scattered over different studies impeding the selection and application of the feasible approaches. This study provides an overview of the developed attention mechanisms and how to integrate them with different deep learning neural network architectures. In addition, it aims to investigate the effect of the attention mechanism on deep learning-based RS image processing. We identified and analyzed the advances in the corresponding attention mechanism-based deep learning (At-DL) methods. A systematic literature review was performed to identify the trends in publications, publishers, improved DL methods, data types used, attention types used, overall accuracies achieved using At-DL methods, and extracted the current research directions, weaknesses, and open problems to provide insights and recommendations for future studies. For this, five main research questions were formulated to extract the required data and information from the literature. Furthermore, we categorized the papers regarding the addressed RS image processing tasks (e.g., image classification, object detection, and change detection) and discussed the results within each group. In total, 270 papers were retrieved, of which 176 papers were selected according to the defined exclusion criteria for further analysis and detailed review. The results reveal that most of the papers reported an increase in overall accuracy when using the attention mechanism within the DL methods for image classification, image segmentation, change detection, and object detection using remote sensing images.",

    "abstract": "Microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi play essential roles in many application fields, like biotechnique, medical technique and industrial domain. Microorganism counting techniques are crucial in microorganism analysis, helping biologists and related researchers quantitatively analyze the microorganisms and calculate their characteristics, such as biomass concentration and biological activity. However, traditional microorganism manual counting methods, such as plate counting method, hemocytometry and turbidimetry, are time-consuming, subjective and need complex operations, which are difficult to be applied in large-scale applications. In order to improve this situation, image analysis is applied for microorganism counting since the 1980s, which consists of digital image processing, image segmentation, image classification and suchlike. Image analysis-based microorganism counting methods are efficient comparing with traditional plate counting methods. In this article, we have studied the development of microorganism counting methods using digital image analysis. Firstly, the microorganisms are grouped as bacteria and other microorganisms. Then, the related articles are summarized based on image segmentation methods. Each part of the article is reviewed by methodologies. Moreover, commonly used image processing methods for microorganism counting are summarized and analyzed to find common technological points. More than 144 papers are outlined in this article. In conclusion, this paper provides new ideas for the future development trend of microorganism counting, and provides systematic suggestions for implementing integrated microorganism counting systems in the future. Researchers in other fields can refer to the techniques analyzed in this paper.",

    "abstract": "\nPurpose\nIn the production processes of electronic devices, production activities are interrupted due to the problems caused by soldering defects during the assembly of surface-mounted elements on printed circuit boards (PCBs), and this leads to an increase in production costs. In solder paste applications, defects that may occur in electronic cards are usually noticed at the last stage of the production process. This situation reduces the efficiency of production and causes delays in the delivery schedule of critical systems. This study aims to overcome these problems, optimization based deep learning model has been proposed by using 2D signal processing methods.\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nAn optimization-based deep learning model is proposed by using image-processing techniques to detect solder paste defects on PCBs with high performance at an early stage. Convolutional neural network, one of the deep learning methods, is trained using the data set obtained for this study, and pad regions on PCB are classified.\n\nFindings\nA total of six types of classes used in the study consist of uncorrectable soldering, missing soldering, excess soldering, short circuit, undefined object and correct soldering, which are frequently used in the literature. The validity of the model has been tested on the data set consisting of 648 test data.\n\nOriginality/value\nThe effect of image processing and optimization methods on model performance is examined.

    "abstract": "Achieving robustness to distributional shift is a longstanding and challenging goal of computer vision. Data augmentation is a commonly used approach for improving robustness, however robustness gains are typically not uniform across corruption types. Indeed increasing performance in the presence of random noise is often met with reduced performance on other corruptions such as contrast change. Understanding when and why these sorts of trade-offs occur is a crucial step towards mitigating them. Towards this end, we investigate recently observed trade-offs caused by Gaussian data augmentation and adversarial training. We find that both methods improve robustness to corruptions that are concentrated in the high frequency domain while reducing robustness to corruptions that are concentrated in the low frequency domain. This suggests that one way to mitigate these trade-offs via data augmentation is to use a more diverse set of augmentations. Towards this end we observe that AutoAugment, a recently proposed data augmentation policy optimized for clean accuracy, achieves state-of-the-art robustness on the CIFAR-10-C benchmark.",

    "title": "Events-To-Video: Bringing Modern Computer Vision to Event Cameras",
    "abstract": "Event cameras are novel sensors that report brightness changes in the form of asynchronous \"events\" instead of intensity frames. They have significant advantages over conventional cameras: high temporal resolution, high dynamic range, and no motion blur. Since the output of event cameras is fundamentally different from conventional cameras, it is commonly accepted that they require the development of specialized algorithms to accommodate the particular nature of events. In this work, we take a different view and propose to apply existing, mature computer vision techniques to videos reconstructed from event data. We propose a novel, recurrent neural network to reconstruct videos from a stream of events and train it on a large amount of simulated event data. Our experiments show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art reconstruction methods by a large margin (> 20%) in terms of image quality. We further apply off-the-shelf computer vision algorithms to videos reconstructed from event data on tasks such as object classification and visual-inertial odometry, and show that this strategy consistently outperforms algorithms that were specifically designed for event data. We believe that our approach opens the door to bringing the outstanding properties of event cameras to an entirely new range of tasks.",

The aim of this paper is to promote a discussion on whether knowledge of classical computer vision techniques should be maintained. The paper will also explore how the two sides of computer vision can be combined. Several recent hybrid methodologies are reviewed which have demonstrated the ability to improve computer vision performance and to tackle problems not suited to Deep Learning.

    "abstract": "Most animal species on Earth are insects, and recent reports suggest that their abundance is in drastic decline. Although these reports come from a wide range of insect taxa and regions, the evidence to assess the extent of the phenomenon is sparse. Insect populations are challenging to study, and most monitoring methods are labor intensive and inefficient. Advances in computer vision and deep learning provide potential new solutions to this global challenge. Cameras and other sensors can effectively, continuously, and noninvasively perform entomological observations throughout diurnal and seasonal cycles. The physical appearance of specimens can also be captured by automated imaging in the laboratory. When trained on these data, deep learning models can provide estimates of insect abundance, biomass, and diversity. Further, deep learning models can quantify variation in phenotypic traits, behavior, and interactions. Here, we connect recent developments in deep learning and computer vision to the urgent demand for more cost-efficient monitoring of insects and other invertebrates. We present examples of sensor-based monitoring of insects. We show how deep learning tools can be applied to exceptionally large datasets to derive ecological information and discuss the challenges that lie ahead for the implementation of such solutions in entomology. We identify four focal areas, which will facilitate this transformation: 1) validation of image-based taxonomic identification; 2) generation of sufficient training data; 3) development of public, curated reference databases; and 4) solutions to integrate deep learning and molecular tools.",

    "abstract": "As the computing power of modern hardware is increasing strongly, pre-trained deep learning models (e.g., BERT, GPT-3) learned on large-scale datasets have shown their effectiveness over conventional methods. The big progress is mainly contributed to the representation ability of transformer and its variant architectures. In this paper, we study the low-level computer vision task (e.g., denoising, super-resolution and deraining) and develop a new pre-trained model, namely, image processing transformer (IPT). To maximally excavate the capability of transformer, we present to utilize the well-known ImageNet benchmark for generating a large amount of corrupted image pairs. The IPT model is trained on these images with multi-heads and multi-tails. In addition, the contrastive learning is introduced for well adapting to different image processing tasks. The pre-trained model can therefore efficiently employed on desired task after fine-tuning. With only one pre-trained model, IPT outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods on various low-level benchmarks.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a new vision Transformer, called Swin Transformer, that capably serves as a general-purpose backbone for computer vision. Challenges in adapting Transformer from language to vision arise from differences between the two domains, such as large variations in the scale of visual entities and the high resolution of pixels in images compared to words in text. To address these differences, we propose a hierarchical Transformer whose representation is computed with Shifted windows. The shifted windowing scheme brings greater efficiency by limiting self-attention computation to non-overlapping local windows while also allowing for cross-window connection. This hierarchical architecture has the flexibility to model at various scales and has linear computational complexity with respect to image size. These qualities of Swin Transformer make it compatible with a broad range of vision tasks, including image classification (87.3 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K) and dense prediction tasks such as object detection (58.7 box AP and 51.1 mask AP on COCO test-dev) and semantic segmentation (53.5 mIoU on ADE20K val). Its performance surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by a large margin of +2.7 box AP and +2.6 mask AP on COCO, and +3.2 mIoU on ADE20K, demonstrating the potential of Transformer-based models as vision backbones. The hierarchical design and the shifted window approach also prove beneficial for all-MLP architectures. The code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/microsoft/Swin-Transformer.",

    "title": "Masked Autoencoders Are Scalable Vision Learners",
    "abstract": "This paper shows that masked autoencoders (MAE) are scalable self-supervised learners for computer vision. Our MAE approach is simple: we mask random patches of the input image and reconstruct the missing pixels. It is based on two core designs. First, we develop an asymmetric encoder-decoder architecture, with an encoder that operates only on the visible subset of patches (without mask tokens), along with a lightweight decoder that reconstructs the original image from the latent representation and mask tokens. Second, we find that masking a high proportion of the input image, e.g., 75%, yields a nontrivial and meaningful self-supervisory task. Coupling these two designs enables us to train large models efficiently and effectively: we accelerate training (by 3\u00d7 or more) and improve accuracy. Our scalable approach allows for learning high-capacity models that generalize well: e.g., a vanilla ViT-Huge model achieves the best accuracy (87.8%) among methods that use only ImageNet-1K data. Transfer performance in downstream tasks outperforms supervised pretraining and shows promising scaling behavior.",

    "title": "Florence: A New Foundation Model for Computer Vision",
    "abstract": "Automated visual understanding of our diverse and open world demands computer vision models to generalize well with minimal customization for specific tasks, similar to human vision. Computer vision foundation models, which are trained on diverse, large-scale dataset and can be adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks, are critical for this mission to solve real-world computer vision applications. While existing vision foundation models such as CLIP, ALIGN, and Wu Dao 2.0 focus mainly on mapping images and textual representations to a cross-modal shared representation, we introduce a new computer vision foundation model, Florence, to expand the representations from coarse (scene) to fine (object), from static (images) to dynamic (videos), and from RGB to multiple modalities (caption, depth). By incorporating universal visual-language representations from Web-scale image-text data, our Florence model can be easily adapted for various computer vision tasks, such as classification, retrieval, object detection, VQA, image caption, video retrieval and action recognition. Moreover, Florence demonstrates outstanding performance in many types of transfer learning: fully sampled fine-tuning, linear probing, few-shot transfer and zero-shot transfer for novel images and objects. All of these properties are critical for our vision foundation model to serve general purpose vision tasks. Florence achieves new state-of-the-art results in majority of 44 representative benchmarks, e.g., ImageNet-1K zero-shot classification with top-1 accuracy of 83.74 and the top-5 accuracy of 97.18, 62.4 mAP on COCO fine tuning, 80.36 on VQA, and 87.8 on Kinetics-600.",

    "abstract": "Methods for collecting animal behaviour data in natural environments, such as direct observation and biologging, are typically limited in spatiotemporal resolution, the number of animals that can be observed and information about animals' social and physical environments. Video imagery can capture rich information about animals and their environments, but image-based approaches are often impractical due to the challenges of processing large and complex multi-image datasets and transforming resulting data, such as animals' locations, into geographical coordinates. We demonstrate a new system for studying behaviour in the wild that uses drone-recorded videos and computer vision approaches to automatically track the location and body posture of free-roaming animals in georeferenced coordinates with high spatiotemporal resolution embedded in contemporaneous 3D landscape models of the surrounding area. We provide two worked examples in which we apply this approach to videos of gelada monkeys and multiple species of group-living African ungulates. We demonstrate how to track multiple animals simultaneously, classify individuals by species and age-sex class, estimate individuals' body postures (poses) and extract environmental features, including topography of the landscape and animal trails. By quantifying animal movement and posture while reconstructing a detailed 3D model of the landscape, our approach opens the door to studying the sensory ecology and decision-making of animals within their natural physical and social environments.",

In this study, a deep neural network (DNN) was adopted for Facial emotion recognition (FER). One of the objectives in this study is to identify the critical facial features on which the DNN model focuses for FER. In particular, we utilized a convolutional neural network (CNN), the combination of squeeze-and-excitation network and the residual neural network, for the task of FER. We utilized AffectNet and the Real-World Affective Faces Database (RAF-DB) as the facial expression databases that provide learning samples for the CNN. The feature maps were extracted from the residual blocks for further analysis. Our analysis shows that the features around the nose and mouth are critical facial landmarks for the neural networks. Cross-database validations were conducted between the databases. The network model trained on AffectNet achieved 77.37% accuracy when validated on the RAF-DB, while the network model pretrained on AffectNet and then transfer learned on the RAF-DB results in validation accuracy of 83.37%. The outcomes of this study would improve the understanding of neural networks and assist with improving computer vision accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Neural network based computer vision systems are typically built on a backbone, a pretrained or randomly initialized feature extractor. Several years ago, the default option was an ImageNet-trained convolutional neural network. However, the recent past has seen the emergence of countless backbones pretrained using various algorithms and datasets. While this abundance of choice has led to performance increases for a range of systems, it is difficult for practitioners to make informed decisions about which backbone to choose. Battle of the Backbones (BoB) makes this choice easier by benchmarking a diverse suite of pretrained models, including vision-language models, those trained via self-supervised learning, and the Stable Diffusion backbone, across a diverse set of computer vision tasks ranging from classification to object detection to OOD generalization and more. Furthermore, BoB sheds light on promising directions for the research community to advance computer vision by illuminating strengths and weakness of existing approaches through a comprehensive analysis conducted on more than 1500 training runs. While vision transformers (ViTs) and self-supervised learning (SSL) are increasingly popular, we find that convolutional neural networks pretrained in a supervised fashion on large training sets still perform best on most tasks among the models we consider. Moreover, in apples-to-apples comparisons on the same architectures and similarly sized pretraining datasets, we find that SSL backbones are highly competitive, indicating that future works should perform SSL pretraining with advanced architectures and larger pretraining datasets. We release the raw results of our experiments along with code that allows researchers to put their own backbones through the gauntlet here: https://github.com/hsouri/Battle-of-the-Backbones",

    "abstract": ". The faster AI automation spreads through the economy, the more profound its potential impacts, both positive (improved productivity) and negative (worker displacement). The previous literature on \u201cAI Exposure\u201d cannot predict this pace of automation since it attempts to measure an overall potential for AI to affect an area, not the technical feasibility and economic attractiveness of building such systems. In this article, we present a new type of AI task automation model that is end-to-end, estimating: the level of technical performance needed to do a task, the characteristics of an AI system capable of that performance, and the economic choice of whether to build and deploy such a system. The result is a first estimate of which tasks are technically feasible and economically attractive to automate - and which are not. We focus on computer vision, where cost modeling is more developed. We find that at today\u2019s costs U.S. businesses would choose not to automate most vision tasks that have \u201cAI Exposure,\u201d and that only 23% of worker wages being paid for vision tasks would be attractive to automate. This slower roll-out of AI can be accelerated if costs falls rapidly or if it is deployed via AI-as-a-service platforms that have greater scale than individual firms, both of which we quantify. Overall, our findings suggest that AI job displacement will be substantial, but also gradual \u2013 and therefore there is room for policy and retraining to mitigate unemployment impacts.",

    "abstract": "Agriculture is the ultimate imperative and primary source of origin to furnish domestic income for multifarious countries. The disease caused in plants due to various pathogens like viruses, fungi, and bacteria is liable for considerable monetary losses in the agriculture corporation across the world. The security of crops concerning quality and quantity is crucial to monitor disease in plants. Thus, recognition of plant disease is essential. The plant disease syndrome is noticeable in distinct parts of plants. Nonetheless, commonly the infection is detected in distinct leaves of plants. Computer vision, deep learning, few-shot learning, and soft computing techniques are utilized by various investigators to automatically identify the disease in plants via leaf images. These techniques also benefit farmers in achieving expeditious and appropriate actions to avoid a reduction in the quality and quantity of crops. The application of these techniques in the recognition of disease can avert the disadvantage of origin by a factious selection of disease features, extraction of features, and boost the speed of technology and efficiency of research. Also, certain molecular techniques have been established to prevent and mitigate the pathogenic threat. Hence, this review helps the investigator to automatically detect disease in plants using machine learning, deep learning and few shot learning and provide certain diagnosis techniques to prevent disease. Moreover, some of the future works in the classification of disease are also discussed.",

    "abstract": "Pretraining large neural language models, such as BERT, has led to impressive gains on many natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, most pretraining efforts focus on general domain corpora, such as newswire and Web. A prevailing assumption is that even domain-specific pretraining can benefit by starting from general-domain language models. In this article, we challenge this assumption by showing that for domains with abundant unlabeled text, such as biomedicine, pretraining language models from scratch results in substantial gains over continual pretraining of general-domain language models. To facilitate this investigation, we compile a comprehensive biomedical NLP benchmark from publicly available datasets. Our experiments show that domain-specific pretraining serves as a solid foundation for a wide range of biomedical NLP tasks, leading to new state-of-the-art results across the board. Further, in conducting a thorough evaluation of modeling choices, both for pretraining and task-specific fine-tuning, we discover that some common practices are unnecessary with BERT models, such as using complex tagging schemes in named entity recognition. To help accelerate research in biomedical NLP, we have released our state-of-the-art pretrained and task-specific models for the community, and created a leaderboard featuring our BLURB benchmark (short for Biomedical Language Understanding & Reasoning Benchmark) at https://aka.ms/BLURB.",

    "abstract": "This article surveys and organizes research works in a new paradigm in natural language processing, which we dub \u201cprompt-based learning.\u201d Unlike traditional supervised learning, which trains a model to take in an input x and predict an output y as P(y|x), prompt-based learning is based on language models that model the probability of text directly. To use these models to perform prediction tasks, the original input x is modified using a template into a textual string prompt x\u2032 that has some unfilled slots, and then the language model is used to probabilistically fill the unfilled information to obtain a final string x\u0302, from which the final output y can be derived. This framework is powerful and attractive for a number of reasons: It allows the language model to be pre-trained on massive amounts of raw text, and by defining a new prompting function the model is able to perform few-shot or even zero-shot learning, adapting to new scenarios with few or no labeled data. In this article, we introduce the basics of this promising paradigm, describe a unified set of mathematical notations that can cover a wide variety of existing work, and organize existing work along several dimensions, e.g., the choice of pre-trained language models, prompts, and tuning strategies. To make the field more accessible to interested beginners, we not only make a systematic review of existing works and a highly structured typology of prompt-based concepts but also release other resources, e.g., a website NLPedia\u2013Pretrain including constantly updated survey and paperlist.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A fundamental goal of scientific research is to learn about causal relationships. However, despite its critical role in the life and social sciences, causality has not had the same importance in Natural Language Processing (NLP), which has traditionally placed more emphasis on predictive tasks. This distinction is beginning to fade, with an emerging area of interdisciplinary research at the convergence of causal inference and language processing. Still, research on causality in NLP remains scattered across domains without unified definitions, benchmark datasets and clear articulations of the challenges and opportunities in the application of causal inference to the textual domain, with its unique properties. In this survey, we consolidate research across academic areas and situate it in the broader NLP landscape. We introduce the statistical challenge of estimating causal effects with text, encompassing settings where text is used as an outcome, treatment, or to address confounding. In addition, we explore potential uses of causal inference to improve the robustness, fairness, and interpretability of NLP models. We thus provide a unified overview of causal inference for the NLP community.1",

    "abstract": "We tackle the problem of aligning pre-trained large language models (LMs) with human preferences. If we view text generation as a sequential decision-making problem, reinforcement learning (RL) appears to be a natural conceptual framework. However, using RL for LM-based generation faces empirical challenges, including training instability due to the combinatorial action space, as well as a lack of open-source libraries and benchmarks customized for LM alignment. Thus, a question rises in the research community: is RL a practical paradigm for NLP? To help answer this, we first introduce an open-source modular library, RL4LMs (Reinforcement Learning for Language Models), for optimizing language generators with RL. The library consists of on-policy RL algorithms that can be used to train any encoder or encoder-decoder LM in the HuggingFace library (Wolf et al. 2020) with an arbitrary reward function. Next, we present the GRUE (General Reinforced-language Understanding Evaluation) benchmark, a set of 6 language generation tasks which are supervised not by target strings, but by reward functions which capture automated measures of human preference. GRUE is the first leaderboard-style evaluation of RL algorithms for NLP tasks. Finally, we introduce an easy-to-use, performant RL algorithm, NLPO (Natural Language Policy Optimization) that learns to effectively reduce the combinatorial action space in language generation. We show 1) that RL techniques are generally better than supervised methods at aligning LMs to human preferences; and 2) that NLPO exhibits greater stability and performance than previous policy gradient methods (e.g., PPO (Schulman et al. 2017)), based on both automatic and human evaluations.",

    "abstract": "Language models (LMs) are pretrained on diverse data sources\u2014news, discussion forums, books, online encyclopedias. A significant portion of this data includes facts and opinions which, on one hand, celebrate democracy and diversity of ideas, and on the other hand are inherently socially biased. Our work develops new methods to (1) measure media biases in LMs trained on such corpora, along social and economic axes, and (2) measure the fairness of downstream NLP models trained on top of politically biased LMs. We focus on hate speech and misinformation detection, aiming to empirically quantify the effects of political (social, economic) biases in pretraining data on the fairness of high-stakes social-oriented tasks. Our findings reveal that pretrained LMs do have political leanings which reinforce the polarization present in pretraining corpora, propagating social biases into hate speech predictions and media biases into misinformation detectors. We discuss the implications of our findings for NLP research and propose future directions to mitigate unfairness.",

The game of Dota 2 presents novel challenges for AI systems such as long time horizons, imperfect information, and complex, continuous state-action spaces, all challenges which will become increasingly central to more capable AI systems. OpenAI Five leveraged existing reinforcement learning techniques, scaled to learn from batches of approximately 2 million frames every 2 seconds.

    "title": "Meta-World: A Benchmark and Evaluation for Multi-Task and Meta Reinforcement Learning",
    "abstract": "Meta-reinforcement learning algorithms can enable robots to acquire new skills much more quickly, by leveraging prior experience to learn how to learn. However, much of the current research on meta-reinforcement learning focuses on task distributions that are very narrow. For example, a commonly used meta-reinforcement learning benchmark uses different running velocities for a simulated robot as different tasks. When policies are meta-trained on such narrow task distributions, they cannot possibly generalize to more quickly acquire entirely new tasks. Therefore, if the aim of these methods is to enable faster acquisition of entirely new behaviors, we must evaluate them on task distributions that are sufficiently broad to enable generalization to new behaviors. In this paper, we propose an open-source simulated benchmark for meta-reinforcement learning and multi-task learning consisting of 50 distinct robotic manipulation tasks. Our aim is to make it possible to develop algorithms that generalize to accelerate the acquisition of entirely new, held-out tasks. We evaluate 6 state-of-the-art meta-reinforcement learning and multi-task learning algorithms on these tasks. Surprisingly, while each task and its variations (e.g., with different object positions) can be learned with reasonable success, these algorithms struggle to learn with multiple tasks at the same time, even with as few as ten distinct training tasks. Our analysis and open-source environments pave the way for future research in multi-task learning and meta-learning that can enable meaningful generalization, thereby unlocking the full potential of these methods.",

Offline reinforcement learning algorithms hold tremendous promise for making it possible to turn large datasets into powerful decision making engines. Effective offline reinforcement learning methods would be able to extract policies with the maximum possible utility out of the available data, thereby allowing automation of a wide range of decision-making domains, from healthcare and education to robotics. However, the limitations of current algorithms make this difficult.

    "title": "Conservative Q-Learning for Offline Reinforcement Learning",
    "abstract": "Effectively leveraging large, previously collected datasets in reinforcement learning (RL) is a key challenge for large-scale real-world applications. Offline RL algorithms promise to learn effective policies from previously-collected, static datasets without further interaction. However, in practice, offline RL presents a major challenge, and standard off-policy RL methods can fail due to overestimation of values induced by the distributional shift between the dataset and the learned policy, especially when training on complex and multi-modal data distributions. In this paper, we propose conservative Q-learning (CQL), which aims to address these limitations by learning a conservative Q-function such that the expected value of a policy under this Q-function lower-bounds its true value. We theoretically show that CQL produces a lower bound on the value of the current policy and that it can be incorporated into a policy learning procedure with theoretical improvement guarantees. In practice, CQL augments the standard Bellman error objective with a simple Q-value regularizer which is straightforward to implement on top of existing deep Q-learning and actor-critic implementations. On both discrete and continuous control domains, we show that CQL substantially outperforms existing offline RL methods, often learning policies that attain 2-5 times higher final return, especially when learning from complex and multi-modal data distributions.",

    "abstract": "The offline reinforcement learning (RL) problem, also known as batch RL, refers to the setting where a policy must be learned from a static dataset, without additional online data collection. This setting is compelling as potentially it allows RL methods to take advantage of large, pre-collected datasets, much like how the rise of large datasets has fueled results in supervised learning in recent years. However, existing online RL benchmarks are not tailored towards the offline setting, making progress in offline RL difficult to measure. In this work, we introduce benchmarks specifically designed for the offline setting, guided by key properties of datasets relevant to real-world applications of offline RL. Examples of such properties include: datasets generated via hand-designed controllers and human demonstrators, multi-objective datasets where an agent can perform different tasks in the same environment, and datasets consisting of a mixtures of policies. To facilitate research, we release our benchmark tasks and datasets with a comprehensive evaluation of existing algorithms and an evaluation protocol together with an open-source codebase. We hope that our benchmark will focus research effort on methods that drive improvements not just on simulated tasks, but ultimately on the kinds of real-world problems where offline RL will have the largest impact.",

In this sense, this review paper surveys the main existing applications of agricultural robotic systems for the execution of land preparation before planting, sowing, planting, plant treatment, harvesting, yield estimation and phenotyping. In general, all robots were evaluated according to the following criteria: its locomotion system, what is the final application, if it has sensors, robotic arm and/or computer vision algorithm, what is its development stage and which country and continent they belong. After evaluating all similar characteristics, to expose the research trends, common pitfalls and the characteristics that hinder commercial development, and discover which countries are investing into Research and Development (R&D) in these technologies for the future, four major areas that need future research work for enhancing the state of the art in smart agriculture were highlighted: locomotion systems, sensors, computer vision algorithms and communication technologies. The results of this research suggest that the investment in agricultural robotic systems allows to achieve short\u2014harvest monitoring\u2014and long-term objectives\u2014yield estimation.",

This study therefore aims to systematize the academic inputs on intelligent automation so far and to clarify what are its main contributions to and challenges for HRM. In a systematic search of 13,136 potentially relevant studies published in the top HRM, international business (IB), general management (GM) and information management (IM) journals, we found 45 articles studying artificial intelligence, robotics and other advanced technologies within HRM settings. Results show that intelligent automation technologies constitute a new approach to managing employees and enhancing firm performance, thus offering several opportunities for HRM but also considerable challenges at a technological and ethical level. The impact of these technologies has been identified to concentrate on HRM strategies, namely, job replacement, human-robot/AI collaboration, decision-making and learning opportunities, and HRM activities, namely, recruiting, training and job performance. This study discusses these shifts in detail, along with the main contributions to theory and practice and directions for future research.",

    "abstract": "Offline reinforcement learning (RL), which aims to learn an optimal policy using a previously collected static dataset, is an important paradigm of RL. Standard RL methods often perform poorly in this regime due to the function approximation errors on out-of-distribution actions. While a variety of regularization methods have been proposed to mitigate this issue, they are often constrained by policy classes with limited expressiveness that can lead to highly suboptimal solutions. In this paper, we propose representing the policy as a diffusion model, a recent class of highly-expressive deep generative models. We introduce Diffusion Q-learning (Diffusion-QL) that utilizes a conditional diffusion model to represent the policy. In our approach, we learn an action-value function and we add a term maximizing action-values into the training loss of the conditional diffusion model, which results in a loss that seeks optimal actions that are near the behavior policy. We show the expressiveness of the diffusion model-based policy, and the coupling of the behavior cloning and policy improvement under the diffusion model both contribute to the outstanding performance of Diffusion-QL. We illustrate the superiority of our method compared to prior works in a simple 2D bandit example with a multimodal behavior policy. We then show that our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance on the majority of the D4RL benchmark tasks.",

    "title": "RLPrompt: Optimizing Discrete Text Prompts with Reinforcement Learning",
    "abstract": "Prompting has shown impressive success in enabling large pre-trained language models (LMs) to perform diverse NLP tasks, especially with only few downstream data. Automatically finding the optimal prompt for each task, however, is challenging. Most existing work resorts to tuning *soft* prompts (e.g., embeddings) which fall short of interpretability, reusability across LMs, and applicability when gradients are not accessible. *Discrete* prompts, on the other hand, are difficult to optimize, and are often created by \u201cenumeration (e.g., paraphrasing)-then-selection\u201d heuristics that do not explore the prompt space systematically. This paper proposes RLPrompt, an efficient discrete prompt optimization approach with reinforcement learning (RL). RLPrompt formulates a parameter-efficient policy network that generates the optimized discrete prompt after training with reward. To harness the complex and stochastic reward signals from the large LM environment, we incorporate effective reward stabilization that substantially enhances training efficiency. RLPrompt is flexibly applicable to different types of LMs, such as masked (e.g., BERT) and left-to-right models (e.g., GPTs), for both classification and generation tasks. Experiments on few-shot classification and unsupervised text style transfer show superior performance over a wide range of existing fine-tuning or prompting methods. Interestingly, the resulting optimized prompts are often ungrammatical gibberish text; and surprisingly, those gibberish prompts are transferrable between different LMs to retain significant performance, indicating that LM prompting may not follow human language patterns.",

    "title": "Reflexion: language agents with verbal reinforcement learning",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly used to interact with external environments (e.g., games, compilers, APIs) as goal-driven agents. However, it remains challenging for these language agents to quickly and efficiently learn from trial-and-error as traditional reinforcement learning methods require extensive training samples and expensive model fine-tuning. We propose Reflexion, a novel framework to reinforce language agents not by updating weights, but instead through linguistic feedback. Concretely, Reflexion agents verbally reflect on task feedback signals, then maintain their own reflective text in an episodic memory buffer to induce better decision-making in subsequent trials. Reflexion is flexible enough to incorporate various types (scalar values or free-form language) and sources (external or internally simulated) of feedback signals, and obtains significant improvements over a baseline agent across diverse tasks (sequential decision-making, coding, language reasoning). For example, Reflexion achieves a 91% pass@1 accuracy on the HumanEval coding benchmark, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art GPT-4 that achieves 80%. We also conduct ablation and analysis studies using different feedback signals, feedback incorporation methods, and agent types, and provide insights into how they affect performance.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion models are a class of flexible generative models trained with an approximation to the log-likelihood objective. However, most use cases of diffusion models are not concerned with likelihoods, but instead with downstream objectives such as human-perceived image quality or drug effectiveness. In this paper, we investigate reinforcement learning methods for directly optimizing diffusion models for such objectives. We describe how posing denoising as a multi-step decision-making problem enables a class of policy gradient algorithms, which we refer to as denoising diffusion policy optimization (DDPO), that are more effective than alternative reward-weighted likelihood approaches. Empirically, DDPO is able to adapt text-to-image diffusion models to objectives that are difficult to express via prompting, such as image compressibility, and those derived from human feedback, such as aesthetic quality. Finally, we show that DDPO can improve prompt-image alignment using feedback from a vision-language model without the need for additional data collection or human annotation.

    "abstract": "With the development of large language models (LLMs), striking a balance between the performance and safety of AI systems has never been more critical. However, the inherent tension between the objectives of helpfulness and harmlessness presents a significant challenge during LLM training. To address this issue, we propose Safe Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (Safe RLHF), a novel algorithm for human value alignment. Safe RLHF explicitly decouples human preferences regarding helpfulness and harmlessness, effectively avoiding the crowdworkers' confusion about the tension and allowing us to train separate reward and cost models. We formalize the safety concern of LLMs as an optimization task of maximizing the reward function while satisfying specified cost constraints. Leveraging the Lagrangian method to solve this constrained problem, Safe RLHF dynamically adjusts the balance between the two objectives during fine-tuning. Through a three-round fine-tuning using Safe RLHF, we demonstrate a superior ability to mitigate harmful responses while enhancing model performance compared to existing value-aligned algorithms. Experimentally, we fine-tuned the Alpaca-7B using Safe RLHF and aligned it with collected human preferences, significantly improving its helpfulness and harmlessness according to human evaluations.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a continuously growing field that has the potential to revolutionize many areas of artificial intelligence. However, despite its promise, RL research is often hindered by the lack of standardization in environment and algorithm implementations. This makes it difficult for researchers to compare and build upon each other's work, slowing down progress in the field. Gymnasium is an open-source library that provides a standard API for RL environments, aiming to tackle this issue. Gymnasium's main feature is a set of abstractions that allow for wide interoperability between environments and training algorithms, making it easier for researchers to develop and test RL algorithms. In addition, Gymnasium provides a collection of easy-to-use environments, tools for easily customizing environments, and tools to ensure the reproducibility and robustness of RL research. Through this unified framework, Gymnasium significantly streamlines the process of developing and testing RL algorithms, enabling researchers to focus more on innovation and less on implementation details. By providing a standardized platform for RL research, Gymnasium helps to drive forward the field of reinforcement learning and unlock its full potential.

    "abstract": "Self-correction is a highly desirable capability of large language models (LLMs), yet it has consistently been found to be largely ineffective in modern LLMs. Current methods for training self-correction typically depend on either multiple models, a more advanced model, or additional forms of supervision. To address these shortcomings, we develop a multi-turn online reinforcement learning (RL) approach, SCoRe, that significantly improves an LLM's self-correction ability using entirely self-generated data. To build SCoRe, we first show that variants of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on offline model-generated correction traces are often insufficient for instilling self-correction behavior. In particular, we observe that training via SFT falls prey to either a distribution mismatch between mistakes made by the data-collection policy and the model's own responses, or to behavior collapse, where learning implicitly prefers only a certain mode of correction behavior that is often not effective at self-correction on test problems. SCoRe addresses these challenges by training under the model's own distribution of self-generated correction traces and using appropriate regularization to steer the learning process into learning a self-correction behavior that is effective at test time as opposed to fitting high-reward responses for a given prompt. This regularization process includes an initial phase of multi-turn RL on a base model to generate a policy initialization that is less susceptible to collapse, followed by using a reward bonus to amplify self-correction. With Gemini 1.0 Pro and 1.5 Flash models, we find that SCoRe achieves state-of-the-art self-correction performance, improving the base models' self-correction by 15.6% and 9.1% respectively on MATH and HumanEval.",

    "abstract": "We present Self-Play Preference Optimization (SPO), an algorithm for reinforcement learning from human feedback. Our approach is minimalist in that it does not require training a reward model nor unstable adversarial training and is therefore rather simple to implement. Our approach is maximalist in that it provably handles non-Markovian, intransitive, and stochastic preferences while being robust to the compounding errors that plague offline approaches to sequential prediction. To achieve the preceding qualities, we build upon the concept of a Minimax Winner (MW), a notion of preference aggregation from the social choice theory literature that frames learning from preferences as a zero-sum game between two policies. By leveraging the symmetry of this game, we prove that rather than using the traditional technique of dueling two policies to compute the MW, we can simply have a single agent play against itself while maintaining strong convergence guarantees. Practically, this corresponds to sampling multiple trajectories from a policy, asking a preference or teacher model to compare them, and then using the proportion of wins as the reward for a particular trajectory. We demonstrate that on a suite of continuous control tasks, we are able to learn significantly more efficiently than reward-model based approaches while maintaining robustness to the intransitive and stochastic preferences that frequently occur in practice when aggregating human judgments.",

    "title": "Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network",
    "abstract": "Representation learning in heterogeneous graphs aims to pursue a meaningful vector representation for each node so as to facilitate downstream applications such as link prediction, personalized recommendation, node classification, etc. This task, however, is challenging not only because of the demand to incorporate heterogeneous structural (graph) information consisting of multiple types of nodes and edges, but also due to the need for considering heterogeneous attributes or contents (e.g., text or image) associated with each node. Despite a substantial amount of effort has been made to homogeneous (or heterogeneous) graph embedding, attributed graph embedding as well as graph neural networks, few of them can jointly consider heterogeneous structural (graph) information as well as heterogeneous contents information of each node effectively. In this paper, we propose HetGNN, a heterogeneous graph neural network model, to resolve this issue. Specifically, we first introduce a random walk with restart strategy to sample a fixed size of strongly correlated heterogeneous neighbors for each node and group them based upon node types. Next, we design a neural network architecture with two modules to aggregate feature information of those sampled neighboring nodes. The first module encodes \"deep\" feature interactions of heterogeneous contents and generates content embedding for each node. The second module aggregates content (attribute) embeddings of different neighboring groups (types) and further combines them by considering the impacts of different groups to obtain the ultimate node embedding. Finally, we leverage a graph context loss and a mini-batch gradient descent procedure to train the model in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate that HetGNN can outperform state-of-the-art baselines in various graph mining tasks, i.e., link prediction, recommendation, node classification & clustering and inductive node classification & clustering.",

The previous graph neural network (GNN) approaches in few-shot learning have been based on the node-labeling framework, which implicitly models the intra-cluster similarity and the inter-cluster dissimilarity. In contrast, the proposed EGNN learns to predict the edge-labels rather than the node-labels on the graph that enables the evolution of an explicit clustering by iteratively updating the edge-labels with direct exploitation of both intra-cluster similarity and the inter-cluster dissimilarity. It is also well suited for performing on various numbers of classes without retraining, and can be easily extended to perform a transductive inference. The parameters of the EGNN are learned by episodic training with an edge-labeling loss to obtain a well-generalizable model for unseen low-data problem. On both of the supervised and semi-supervised few-shot image classification tasks with two benchmark datasets, the proposed EGNN significantly improves the performances over the existing GNNs.",

    "abstract": "In many important graph data processing applications the acquired information includes both node features and observations of the graph topology. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are designed to exploit both sources of evidence but they do not optimally trade-off their utility and integrate them in a manner that is also universal. Here, universality refers to independence on homophily or heterophily graph assumptions. We address these issues by introducing a new Generalized PageRank (GPR) GNN architecture that adaptively learns the GPR weights so as to jointly optimize node feature and topological information extraction, regardless of the extent to which the node labels are homophilic or heterophilic. Learned GPR weights automatically adjust to the node label pattern, irrelevant on the type of initialization, and thereby guarantee excellent learning performance for label patterns that are usually hard to handle. Furthermore, they allow one to avoid feature over-smoothing, a process which renders feature information nondiscriminative, without requiring the network to be shallow. Our accompanying theoretical analysis of the GPR-GNN method is facilitated by novel synthetic benchmark datasets generated by the so-called contextual stochastic block model. We also compare the performance of our GNN architecture with that of several state-of-the-art GNNs on the problem of node-classification, using well-known benchmark homophilic and heterophilic datasets. The results demonstrate that GPR-GNN offers significant performance improvement compared to existing techniques on both synthetic and benchmark data.",

    "abstract": "A large number of real-world graphs or networks are inherently heterogeneous, involving a diversity of node types and relation types. Heterogeneous graph embedding is to embed rich structural and semantic information of a heterogeneous graph into low-dimensional node representations. Existing models usually define multiple metapaths in a heterogeneous graph to capture the composite relations and guide neighbor selection. However, these models either omit node content features, discard intermediate nodes along the metapath, or only consider one metapath. To address these three limitations, we propose a new model named Metapath Aggregated Graph Neural Network (MAGNN) to boost the final performance. Specifically, MAGNN employs three major components, i.e., the node content transformation to encapsulate input node attributes, the intra-metapath aggregation to incorporate intermediate semantic nodes, and the inter-metapath aggregation to combine messages from multiple metapaths. Extensive experiments on three real-world heterogeneous graph datasets for node classification, node clustering, and link prediction show that MAGNN achieves more accurate prediction results than state-of-the-art baselines.",

Various downstream graph learning tasks have benefited from its recent developments, such as node classification, similarity search, and graph classification. However, prior arts on graph representation learning focus on domain specific problems and train a dedicated model for each graph dataset, which is usually non-transferable to out-of-domain data. Inspired by the recent advances in pre-training from natural language processing and computer vision, we design Graph Contrastive Coding (GCC) --- a self-supervised graph neural network pre-training framework --- to capture the universal network topological properties across multiple networks. We design GCC's pre-training task as subgraph instance discrimination in and across networks and leverage contrastive learning to empower graph neural networks to learn the intrinsic and transferable structural representations. We conduct extensive experiments on three graph learning tasks and ten graph datasets. The results show that GCC pre-trained on a collection of diverse datasets can achieve competitive or better performance to its task-specific and trained-from-scratch counterparts. This suggests that the pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm presents great potential for graph representation learning.",

    "title": "Parameterized Explainer for Graph Neural Network",
    "abstract": "Despite recent progress in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), explaining predictions made by GNNs remains a challenging open problem. The leading method independently addresses the local explanations (i.e., important subgraph structure and node features) to interpret why a GNN model makes the prediction for a single instance, e.g. a node or a graph. As a result, the explanation generated is painstakingly customized for each instance. The unique explanation interpreting each instance independently is not sufficient to provide a global understanding of the learned GNN model, leading to a lack of generalizability and hindering it from being used in the inductive setting. Besides, as it is designed for explaining a single instance, it is challenging to explain a set of instances naturally (e.g., graphs of a given class). In this study, we address these key challenges and propose PGExplainer, a parameterized explainer for GNNs. PGExplainer adopts a deep neural network to parameterize the generation process of explanations, which enables PGExplainer a natural approach to explaining multiple instances collectively. Compared to the existing work, PGExplainer has better generalization ability and can be utilized in an inductive setting easily. Experiments on both synthetic and real-life datasets show highly competitive performance with up to 24.7\\% relative improvement in AUC on explaining graph classification over the leading baseline.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a graph neural network to detect objects from a LiDAR point cloud. Towards this end, we encode the point cloud efficiently in a fixed radius near-neighbors graph. We design a graph neural network, named Point-GNN, to predict the category and shape of the object that each vertex in the graph belongs to. In Point-GNN, we propose an auto-registration mechanism to reduce translation variance, and also design a box merging and scoring operation to combine detections from multiple vertices accurately. Our experiments on the KITTI benchmark show the proposed approach achieves leading accuracy using the point cloud alone and can even surpass fusion-based algorithms. Our results demonstrate the potential of using the graph neural network as a new approach for 3D object detection. The code is available at https://github.com/WeijingShi/Point-GNN.",

    "abstract": "Multivariate Time Series (MTS) forecasting plays a vital role in a wide range of applications. Recently, Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) have become increasingly popular MTS forecasting methods. STGNNs jointly model the spatial and temporal patterns of MTS through graph neural networks and sequential models, significantly improving the prediction accuracy. But limited by model complexity, most STGNNs only consider short-term historical MTS data, such as data over the past one hour. However, the patterns of time series and the dependencies between them (i.e., the temporal and spatial patterns) need to be analyzed based on long-term historical MTS data. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework, in which STGNN is Enhanced by a scalable time series Pre-training model (STEP). Specifically, we design a pre-training model to efficiently learn temporal patterns from very long-term history time series (e.g., the past two weeks) and generate segment-level representations. These representations provide contextual information for short-term time series input to STGNNs and facilitate modeling dependencies between time series. Experiments on three public real-world datasets demonstrate that our framework is capable of significantly enhancing downstream STGNNs, and our pre-training model aptly captures temporal patterns.",

    "abstract": "\n We all depend on mobility, and vehicular transportation affects the daily lives of most of us. Thus, the ability to forecast the state of traffic in a road network is an important functionality and a challenging task. Traffic data is often obtained from sensors deployed in a road network. Recent proposals on spatial-temporal graph neural networks have achieved great progress at modeling complex spatial-temporal correlations in traffic data, by modeling traffic data as a diffusion process. However, intuitively, traffic data encompasses two different kinds of hidden time series signals, namely the diffusion signals and inherent signals. Unfortunately, nearly all previous works coarsely consider traffic signals entirely as the outcome of the diffusion, while neglecting the inherent signals, which impacts model performance negatively. To improve modeling performance, we propose a novel Decoupled Spatial-Temporal Framework (DSTF) that separates the diffusion and inherent traffic information in a data-driven manner, which encompasses a unique estimation gate and a residual decomposition mechanism. The separated signals can be handled subsequently by the diffusion and inherent modules separately. Further, we propose an instantiation of DSTF, Decoupled Dynamic Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Network (D\n 2\n STGNN), that captures spatial-temporal correlations and also features a dynamic graph learning module that targets the learning of the dynamic characteristics of traffic networks. Extensive experiments with four real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that the framework is capable of advancing the state-of-the-art.\n",

    "abstract": "Recently, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been applied to learn priority dispatching rules (PDRs) for solving complex scheduling problems. However, the existing works face challenges in dealing with flexibility, which allows an operation to be scheduled on one out of multiple machines and is often required in practice. Such one-to-many relationship brings additional complexity in both decision making and state representation. This article considers the well-known flexible job-shop scheduling problem and addresses these issues by proposing a novel DRL method to learn high-quality PDRs end to end. The operation selection and the machine assignment are combined as a composite decision. Moreover, based on a novel heterogeneous graph representation of scheduling states, a heterogeneous-graph-neural-network-based architecture is proposed to capture complex relationships among operations and machines. Experiments show that the proposed method outperforms traditional PDRs and is computationally efficient, even on instances of larger scales and different properties unseen in training.",

    "abstract": "One of the important factors affecting micro-video recommender systems is to model the multi-modal user preference on the micro-video. Despite the remarkable performance of prior arts, they are still limited by fusing the user preference derived from different modalities in a unified manner, ignoring the users tend to place different emphasis on different modalities. Furthermore, modality-missing is ubiquity and unavoidable in the micro-video recommendation, some modalities information of micro-videos are lacked in many cases, which negatively affects the multi-modal fusion operations. To overcome these disadvantages, we propose a novel framework for the micro-video recommendation, dubbed Dual Graph Neural Network (DualGNN), upon the user-microvideo bipartite and user co-occurrence graphs, which leverages the correlation between users to collaboratively mine the particular fusion pattern for each user. Specifically, we first introduce a single-modal representation learning module, which performs graph operations on the user-microvideo graph in each modality to capture single-modal user preferences on different modalities. And then, we devise a multi-modal representation learning module to explicitly model the user\u2019s attentions over different modalities and inductively learn the multi-modal user preference. Finally, we propose a prediction module to rank the potential micro-videos for users. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate the significant superiority of our DualGNN over state-of-the-arts methods.",

    "abstract": "With the prevalence of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), massive sensors are deployed on roadside, vehicles, and infrastructures. One key challenge is imputing several different types of missing entries in spatial-temporal traffic data to meet the high-quality demand of data science applied in Cooperative-ITS (C-ITS) since accurate data recovery is critical to many downstream tasks in ITSs, such as traffic monitoring and decision making. For such, it is proposed in this article solutions to three kinds of data recovery tasks in a unified model via spatial-temporal aware Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), named Spatial-Temporal Aware Data Recovery Network (STAR), enabling a real-time and inductive inference. A residual gated temporal convolution network is designed to permit the proposed model to learn the temporal pattern from long sequences with masks and an adaptive memory-based attention model for utilizing implicit spatial correlation. To further exploit the generalization power of GNNs, a sampling-based method is adopted to train the proposed model to be robust and inductive for online servicing. Extensive numerical experiments on two real-world spatial-temporal traffic datasets are performed, and results show that the proposed STAR model consistently outperforms other baselines at 1.5-2.5 times on all kinds of imputation tasks. Moreover, STAR can support recovery data for 2 to 5 hours, with its performance barely unchanged, and has comparable performance in transfer learning and time-series forecast. Experimental results demonstrate that STAR provides adequate performance and rich features for multiple data recovery tasks under the C-ITS scenario.",

    "abstract": "Message-passing graph neural network interatomic potentials (GNN-IPs), particularly those with equivariant representations such as NequIP, are attracting significant attention due to their data efficiency and high accuracy. However, parallelizing GNN-IPs poses challenges because multiple message-passing layers complicate data communication within the spatial decomposition method, which is preferred by many molecular dynamics (MD) packages. In this article, we propose an efficient parallelization scheme compatible with GNN-IPs and develop a package, SevenNet (Scalable EquiVariance-Enabled Neural NETwork), based on the NequIP architecture. For MD simulations, SevenNet interfaces with the LAMMPS package. Through benchmark tests on a 32-GPU cluster with examples of SiO2, SevenNet achieves over 80% parallel efficiency in weak-scaling scenarios and exhibits nearly ideal strong-scaling performance as long as GPUs are fully utilized. However, the strong-scaling performance significantly declines with suboptimal GPU utilization, particularly affecting parallel efficiency in cases involving lightweight models or simulations with small numbers of atoms. We also pretrain SevenNet with a vast data set from the Materials Project (dubbed \"SevenNet-0\") and assess its performance on generating amorphous Si3N4 containing more than 100,000 atoms. By developing scalable GNN-IPs, this work aims to bridge the gap between advanced machine-learning models and large-scale MD simulations, offering researchers a powerful tool to explore complex material systems with high accuracy and efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Accurately predicting multi-energy loads is essential for optimizing the dispatch and economic operation of integrated energy systems (IES). However, existing multi-energy load forecasting methods have two main limitations: (1) they fail to consider the complex correlations between multi-energy loads and auxiliary features; (2) single time-scale feature extraction methods can result in the loss of critical temporal feature information. Therefore, multi-energy load forecasting remains a challenging task. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a novel multi-energy load forecasting method based on a multi-scale spatio-temporal graph neural network (MS-STGNN). Specifically, the proposed continuous graph learning module quantifies the correlations between multi-energy loads and auxiliary features using an adjacency matrix, while the graph convolution module aggregates feature information among neighboring nodes through the same matrix to improve the correlations between multi-energy loads and auxiliary features. The model\u2019s robustness is further enhanced by the feature attention module. Moreover, to mitigate temporal feature information loss, we develop a multi-scale convolution module that uses filters of various sizes to extract multi-dimensional temporal features of different time steps. Extensive experiments show that the MS-STGNN method has higher prediction accuracy and better generalization ability than existing methods on the IES dataset at the Tempe campus of Arizona State University.

    "abstract": "\u201cA Mathematical Theory of Communication\u201d was published in 1948 by Claude Shannon to address the problems in the field of data compression and communication over (noisy) communication channels. Since then, the concepts and ideas developed in Shannon\u2019s work have formed the basis of information theory, a cornerstone of statistical learning and inference, and has been playing a key role in disciplines such as physics and thermodynamics, probability and statistics, computational sciences and biological sciences. In this article we review the basic information theory based concepts and describe their key applications in multiple major areas of research in computational biology\u2014gene expression and transcriptomics, alignment-free sequence comparison, sequencing and error correction, genome-wide disease-gene association mapping, metabolic networks and metabolomics, and protein sequence, structure and interaction analysis.",

    "abstract": "The problem of reconstructing a string from its error-prone copies, the trace reconstruction problem, was introduced by Vladimir Levenshtein two decades ago. While there has been considerable theoretical work on trace reconstruction, practical solutions have only recently started to emerge in the context of two rapidly developing research areas: immunogenomics and DNA data storage. In immunogenomics, traces correspond to mutated copies of genes, with mutations generated naturally by the adaptive immune system. In DNA data storage, traces correspond to noisy copies of DNA molecules that encode digital data, with errors being artifacts of the data retrieval process. In this paper, we introduce several new trace generation models and open questions relevant to trace reconstruction for immunogenomics and DNA data storage, survey theoretical results on trace reconstruction, and highlight their connections to computational biology. Throughout, we discuss the applicability and shortcomings of known solutions and suggest future research directions.",

In the past decade, high-performance computing has also contributed significantly to addressing complex problems in bio-engineering, healthcare and systems biology. Therefore, computational biology applications provide several compelling examples that can be potent pedagogical tools in teaching high-performance computing. In this paper, we introduce a novel course curriculum to teach high-performance, parallel and distributed computing to senior graduate students (PhD) in a hands-on setup through examples drawn from a wealth of areas in computational biology. We introduce the concepts of parallel programming, algorithms and architectures and implementations via carefully chosen examples from computational biology. We believe that this course curriculum will provide students an engaging and refreshing introduction to this well-established domain.",

    "abstract": "Computational thinking (CT) is an essential skill in the twenty-first century. The computational physics course (CPC) is one subject that is designed to support students in the practice of CT. Many studies show that the worksheets could be a solution in a CPC as a scaffold to achieve the CT objectives both online and offline. The study aims to develop the worksheet and integrate it with CT in a computational physics course. This study applied the research and development (R & D) method with the ADDIE model approach. In the results, the evaluation test from the experts reached a very good interpretation score based on the learning media expert (96%), the teaching material expert (95%), and the pedagogy experts (92%). So that this media is declared feasible to be used in the CPC. Furthermore, after the experimental study of students who took the computational physics course (n\u2009=\u200931), the study showed that the modified course could significantly improve student skills regarding overall CT (p value <0.05). However, this research also found that cooperative learning as part of CT had no improvement (p value >0.05). The experiment was conducted amid the COVID 19 pandemic wherein the students could only study at home for the whole semester. These findings indicate that the pandemic has impacted the collaborative skills of students on the course.",

    "abstract": "Classification algorithms have recently found applications in computational physics for the selection of numerical methods or models adapted to the environment and the state of the physical system. For such classification tasks, labeled training data come from numerical simulations and generally correspond to physical fields discretized on a mesh. Three challenging difficulties arise: the lack of training data, their high dimensionality, and the non-applicability of common data augmentation techniques to physics data. This article introduces two algorithms to address these issues: one for dimensionality reduction via feature selection, and one for data augmentation. These algorithms are combined with a wide variety of classifiers for their evaluation. When combined with a stacking ensemble made of six multilayer perceptrons and a ridge logistic regression, they enable reaching an accuracy of 90% on our classification problem for nonlinear structural mechanics.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to analyze the factor model affecting the implementation of the Generative Learning Model with a Cognitive Conflict Strategy in the Computational Physics Course during the COVID-19 pandemic era. This study used quantitative descriptive data. The research respondents were 105 Physics study program students who took the Computational Physics course for the 2020/2021 academic year. A questionnaire with the Likert Scale used for the survey has been tested for validity by experts and limited tryout. The questionnaire used has high validity and reliability. Data were used for modeling structural equations through Exploration Factor Analysis (EFA). EFA results were used to determine the level of Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) to obtain a complete Structural Equation Modeling. The results show that dynamic interactions and interdependent correlations are formed between variables that affect the implementation of Computational Physics learning. After analyzing the 20 (twenty) variables, it was formed 5 (five) factors affecting the implementation of the Generative Learning Model with a Cognitive Conflict Strategy in the Computational Physics Course. The five influencing factors are 1) the learning syntax and teaching materials used (x1); 2) the activity of expressing ideas (disclosure) and model practice (x2); 3) learning styles and creative thinking (x3); 4) Attitudes and final target score of learning (x4); 5) attitude towards learning materials and learning methods (x5). The five factors produce a model F = 0.366 x1 + 0.161 x2 + 0. 959 x3\u00a0 + 0.682 x4 + 0. 549 x5.",

The The purpose of this needs analysis research was to determine the factors and aspects needed for the development of a cognitive conflict-based generative learning model in Computational Physics. This research was surveyed 132 students who have been and are currently attending Computational Physics lectures by using a questionnaire with a valid and reliable Likert Scale. Questionnaires were distributed through google form media for 20 days. The results showed that students needed a challenge given to each new topic to arouse curiosity and needed an assimilation process to build knowledge about Computational Physics. Students feel the need to think creatively to build knowledge of problem solving in Computational Physics. So, changes in strategies and methods as well as learning steps by lecturers are a must. Finally, The factor relationship model that affects the computational physics learning process is f(x) = 0.325X1 +0.224 X2 + 0.152X3. where X1 is attitude towards Computational Physics, X2 is teaching material and learning model, and X3 is learning style and creative thinking.",

    "abstract": "Computation is intertwined with essentially all aspects of physics research and is invaluable for physicists' careers. Despite its disciplinary importance, integration of computation into physics education remains a challenge and, moreover, has tended to be constructed narrowly as a route to solving physics problems. Here, we broaden Physics Education Research's conception of computation by constructing an epistemic \\emph{metamodel} -- a model of modeling -- incorporating insights on computational modeling from the philosophy of science and prior work. The metamodel is formulated in terms of practices, things physicists do, and how these inform one another. We operationalize this metamodel in an educational environment that incorporates making, the creation of shared physical and digital artifacts, intended to promote students' agency, creativity and self-expression alongside doing physics. We present a content analysis of student work from initial implementations of this approach to illustrate the very complex epistemic maneuvers students make as they engaged in computational modeling. We demonstrate how our metamodel can be used to understand student practices, and conclude with implications of the metamodel for instruction and future research.",

We propose the use of the variance-frequency diagram, as a viable alternative to the study of the power spectral density (PSD), which is not yet accessible for distant, faint and/or sparsely sampled AGN. We show that the data collected from archival observations and previous literature studies are fully consistent with a universal PSD form which does not show any evidence for systematic evolution of shape or amplitude with redshift or luminosity, even if there may be differences between individual AGN at a given redshift or luminosity. We find new evidence that the PSD bend frequency depends on BH mass and, possibly, on accretion rate. We finally discuss the implications for current and future AGN population and cosmological studies.",

These lecture notes exploit the strong connections between deep learning algorithms and the more conventional techniques of computational physics to achieve two goals. First, they use concepts from computational physics to develop an understanding of deep learning algorithms. Not surprisingly, many concepts in deep learning can be connected to similar concepts in computational physics, and one can utilize this connection to better understand these algorithms. Second, several novel deep learning algorithms can be used to solve challenging problems in computational physics.

    "abstract": "Memristor-enabled in-memory computing provides an unconventional computing paradigm to surpass the energy efficiency of von Neumann computers. Owing to the limitation of the computing mechanism, while the crossbar structure is desirable for dense computation, the system\u2019s energy and area efficiency degrade substantially in performing sparse computation tasks, such as scientific computing. In this work, we report a high-efficiency in-memory sparse computing system based on a self-rectifying memristor array. This system originates from an analog computing mechanism that is motivated by the device\u2019s self-rectifying nature, which can achieve an overall performance of ~97 to ~11 TOPS/W for 2- to 8-bit sparse computation when processing practical scientific computing tasks. Compared to previous in-memory computing system, this work provides over 85 times improvement in energy efficiency with an approximately 340 times reduction in hardware overhead. This work can pave the road toward a highly efficient in-memory computing platform for high-performance computing.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Computational biology involves applying computer science and informatics techniques in biology to understand complex biological data. It allows us to collect, connect, and analyze biological data at a large scale and build predictive models. In the twenty first century, computational resources along with Artificial Intelligence (AI) have been widely used in various fields of biological sciences such as biochemistry, structural biology, immunology, microbiology, and genomics to handle massive data for decision-making, including in applications such as drug design and vaccine development, one of the major areas of focus for human and animal welfare. The knowledge of available computational resources and AI-enabled tools in vaccine design and development can improve our ability to conduct cutting-edge research. Therefore, this review article aims to summarize important computational resources and AI-based tools. Further, the article discusses the various applications and limitations of AI tools in vaccine development. Graphical abstract PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY The application of vaccines is one of the most promising treatments for numerous infectious diseases. However, the design and development of effective vaccines involve huge investments and resources, and only a handful of candidates successfully reach the market. Only relying on traditional methods is both time-consuming and expensive. Various computational tools and software have been developed to accelerate the vaccine design and development. Further, AI-enabled computational tools have revolutionized the field of vaccine design and development by creating predictive models and data-driven decision-making processes. Therefore, information and awareness of these AI-enabled computational resources will immensely facilitate the development of vaccines against emerging pathogens. In this review, we have meticulously summarized the available computational tools for each step of in-silico vaccine design and development, delving into the transformative applications of AI and ML in this domain, which would help to choose appropriate tools for each step during vaccine development, and also highlighting the limitations of these tools to facilitate the selection of appropriate tools for each step of vaccine design.",

    "abstract": "Deep Learning is a state-of-the-art technique to make inference on extensive or complex data. As a black box model due to their multilayer nonlinear structure, Deep Neural Networks are often criticized as being non-transparent and their predictions not traceable by humans. Furthermore, the models learn from artificially generated datasets, which often do not reflect reality. By basing decision-making algorithms on Deep Neural Networks, prejudice and unfairness may be promoted unknowingly due to a lack of transparency. Hence, several so-called explanators, or explainers, have been developed. Explainers try to give insight into the inner structure of machine learning black boxes by analyzing the connection between the input and output. In this survey, we present the mechanisms and properties of explaining systems for Deep Neural Networks for Computer Vision tasks. We give a comprehensive overview about the taxonomy of related studies and compare several survey papers that deal with explainability in general. We work out the drawbacks and gaps and summarize further research ideas.",

    "abstract": "While deep neural networks have become the go-to approach in computer vision, the vast majority of these models fail to properly capture the uncertainty inherent in their predictions. Estimating this predictive uncertainty can be crucial, for example in automotive applications. In Bayesian deep learning, predictive uncertainty is commonly decomposed into the distinct types of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. The former can be estimated by letting a neural network output the parameters of a certain probability distribution. Epistemic uncertainty estimation is a more challenging problem, and while different scalable methods recently have emerged, no extensive comparison has been performed in a real-world setting. We therefore accept this task and propose a comprehensive evaluation framework for scalable epistemic uncertainty estimation methods in deep learning. Our proposed framework is specifically designed to test the robustness required in real-world computer vision applications. We also apply this framework to provide the first properly extensive and conclusive comparison of the two current state-of-the- art scalable methods: ensembling and MC-dropout. Our comparison demonstrates that ensembling consistently provides more reliable and practically useful uncertainty estimates. Code is available at https://github.com/fregu856/evaluating_bdl.",

    "abstract": "We introduce the MNIST-C dataset, a comprehensive suite of 15 corruptions applied to the MNIST test set, for benchmarking out-of-distribution robustness in computer vision. Through several experiments and visualizations we demonstrate that our corruptions significantly degrade performance of state-of-the-art computer vision models while preserving the semantic content of the test images. In contrast to the popular notion of adversarial robustness, our model-agnostic corruptions do not seek worst-case performance but are instead designed to be broad and diverse, capturing multiple failure modes of modern models. In fact, we find that several previously published adversarial defenses significantly degrade robustness as measured by MNIST-C. We hope that our benchmark serves as a useful tool for future work in designing systems that are able to learn robust feature representations that capture the underlying semantics of the input.",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks provide unprecedented performance gains in many real-world problems in signal and image processing. Despite these gains, the future development and practical deployment of deep networks are hindered by their black-box nature, i.e., a lack of interpretability and the need for very large training sets. An emerging technique called algorithm unrolling, or unfolding, offers promise in eliminating these issues by providing a concrete and systematic connection between iterative algorithms that are widely used in signal processing and deep neural networks. Unrolling methods were first proposed to develop fast neural network approximations for sparse coding. More recently, this direction has attracted enormous attention, and it is rapidly growing in both theoretic investigations and practical applications. The increasing popularity of unrolled deep networks is due, in part, to their potential in developing efficient, high-performance (yet interpretable) network architectures from reasonably sized training sets.",

    "abstract": "Despite the success of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in image synthesis, applying trained GAN models to real image processing remains challenging. Previous methods typically invert a target image back to the latent space either by back-propagation or by learning an additional encoder. However, the reconstructions from both of the methods are far from ideal. In this work, we propose a novel approach, called mGANprior, to incorporate the well-trained GANs as effective prior to a variety of image processing tasks. In particular, we employ multiple latent codes to generate multiple feature maps at some intermediate layer of the generator, then compose them with adaptive channel importance to recover the input image. Such an over-parameterization of the latent space significantly improves the image reconstruction quality, outperforming existing competitors. The resulting high-fidelity image reconstruction enables the trained GAN models as prior to many real-world applications, such as image colorization, super-resolution, image inpainting, and semantic manipulation. We further analyze the properties of the layer-wise representation learned by GAN models and shed light on what knowledge each layer is capable of representing.",

Correspondingly, various applications related to image processing are also promoting the rapid development of deep learning in all aspects of network structure, layer designing, and training tricks. However, the deeper structure makes the back-propagation algorithm more difficult. At the same time, the scale of training images without labels is also rapidly increasing, and class imbalance severely affects the performance of deep learning, these urgently require more novelty deep models and new parallel computing system to more effectively interpret the content of the image and form a suitable analysis mechanism. In this context, this survey provides four deep learning model series, which includes CNN series, GAN series, ELM-RVFL series, and other series, for comprehensive understanding towards the analytical techniques of image processing field, clarify the most important advancements and shed some light on future studies. By further studying the relationship between deep learning and image processing tasks, which can not only help us understand the reasons for the success of deep learning but also inspires new deep models and training methods. More importantly, this survey aims to improve or arouse other researchers to catch a glimpse of the state-of-the-art deep learning methods in the field of image processing and facilitate the applications of these deep learning technologies in their research tasks. Besides, we discuss the open issues and the promising directions of future research in image processing using the new generation of deep learning.",

    "abstract": "Any computer vision application development starts off by acquiring images and data, then preprocessing and pattern recognition steps to perform a task. When the acquired images are highly imbalanced and not adequate, the desired task may not be achievable. Unfortunately, the occurrence of imbalance problems in acquired image datasets in certain complex real-world problems such as anomaly detection, emotion recognition, medical image analysis, fraud detection, metallic surface defect detection, disaster prediction, etc., are inevitable. The performance of computer vision algorithms can significantly deteriorate when the training dataset is imbalanced. In recent years, Generative Adversarial Neural Networks (GANs) have gained immense attention by researchers across a variety of application domains due to their capability to model complex real-world image data. It is particularly important that GANs can not only be used to generate synthetic images, but also its fascinating adversarial learning idea showed good potential in restoring balance in imbalanced datasets. In this paper, we examine the most recent developments of GANs based techniques for addressing imbalance problems in image data. The real-world challenges and implementations of synthetic image generation based on GANs are extensively covered in this survey. Our survey first introduces various imbalance problems in computer vision tasks and its existing solutions, and then examines key concepts such as deep generative image models and GANs. After that, we propose a taxonomy to summarize GANs based techniques for addressing imbalance problems in computer vision tasks into three major categories: 1. Image level imbalances in classification, 2. object level imbalances in object detection and 3. pixel level imbalances in segmentation tasks. We elaborate the imbalance problems of each group, and provide GANs based solutions in each group. Readers will understand how GANs based techniques can handle the problem of imbalances and boost performance of the computer vision algorithms.",

Through mathematical extraction of the spatial distribution of signal intensities and pixel interrelationships, radiomics quantifies textural information by using analysis methods from the field of artificial intelligence. Various studies from different fields in imaging have been published so far, highlighting the potential of radiomics to enhance clinical decision-making. However, the field faces several important challenges, which are mainly caused by the various technical factors influencing the extracted radiomic features. The aim of the present review is twofold: first, we present the typical workflow of a radiomics analysis and deliver a practical \u201chow-to\u201d guide for a typical radiomics analysis. Second, we discuss the current limitations of radiomics, suggest potential improvements, and summarize relevant literature on the subject.",

    "abstract": "Advancements in deep learning techniques carry the potential to make significant contributions to healthcare, particularly in fields that utilize medical imaging for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment decisions. The current state-of-the-art deep learning models for radiology applications consider only pixel-value information without data informing clinical context. Yet in practice, pertinent and accurate non-imaging data based on the clinical history and laboratory data enable physicians to interpret imaging findings in the appropriate clinical context, leading to a higher diagnostic accuracy, informative clinical decision making, and improved patient outcomes. To achieve a similar goal using deep learning, medical imaging pixel-based models must also achieve the capability to process contextual data from electronic health records (EHR) in addition to pixel data. In this paper, we describe different data fusion techniques that can be applied to combine medical imaging with EHR, and systematically review medical data fusion literature published between 2012 and 2020. We conducted a systematic search on PubMed and Scopus for original research articles leveraging deep learning for fusion of multimodality data. In total, we screened 985 studies and extracted data from 17 papers. By means of this systematic review, we present current knowledge, summarize important results and provide implementation guidelines to serve as a reference for researchers interested in the application of multimodal fusion in medical imaging.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) continues to garner substantial interest in medical imaging. The potential applications are vast and include the entirety of the medical imaging life cycle from image creation to diagnosis to outcome prediction. The chief obstacles to development and clinical implementation of AI algorithms include availability of sufficiently large, curated, and representative training data that includes expert labeling (eg, annotations). Current supervised AI methods require a curation process for data to optimally train, validate, and test algorithms. Currently, most research groups and industry have limited data access based on small sample sizes from small geographic areas. In addition, the preparation of data is a costly and time-intensive process, the results of which are algorithms with limited utility and poor generalization. In this article, the authors describe fundamental steps for preparing medical imaging data in AI algorithm development, explain current limitations to data curation, and explore new approaches to address the problem of data availability.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we question if self-supervised learning provides new properties to Vision Transformer (ViT) [16] that stand out compared to convolutional networks (convnets). Beyond the fact that adapting self-supervised methods to this architecture works particularly well, we make the following observations: first, self-supervised ViT features contain explicit information about the semantic segmentation of an image, which does not emerge as clearly with supervised ViTs, nor with convnets. Second, these features are also excellent k-NN classifiers, reaching 78.3% top-1 on ImageNet with a small ViT. Our study also underlines the importance of momentum encoder [26], multi-crop training [9], and the use of small patches with ViTs. We implement our findings into a simple self-supervised method, called DINO, which we interpret as a form of self-distillation with no labels. We show the synergy between DINO and ViTs by achieving 80.1% top-1 on ImageNet in linear evaluation with ViT-Base.",

    "abstract": "Computer vision is becoming an increasingly trendy word in the area of image processing. With the emergence of computer vision applications, there is a significant demand to recognize objects automatically. Deep CNN (convolution neural network) has benefited the computer vision community by producing excellent results in video processing, object recognition, picture classification and segmentation, natural language processing, speech recognition, and many other fields. Furthermore, the introduction of large amounts of data and readily available hardware has opened new avenues for CNN study. Several inspirational concepts for the progress of CNN have been investigated, including alternative activation functions, regularization, parameter optimization, and architectural advances. Furthermore, achieving innovations in architecture results in a tremendous enhancement in the capacity of the deep CNN. Significant emphasis has been given to leveraging channel and spatial information, with a depth of architecture and information processing via multi-path. This survey paper focuses mainly on the primary taxonomy and newly released deep CNN architectures, and it divides numerous recent developments in CNN architectures into eight groups. Spatial exploitation, multi-path, depth, breadth, dimension, channel boosting, feature-map exploitation, and attention-based CNN are the eight categories. The main contribution of this manuscript is in comparing various architectural evolutions in CNN by its architectural change, strengths, and weaknesses. Besides, it also includes an explanation of the CNN\u2019s components, the strengths and weaknesses of various CNN variants, research gap or open challenges, CNN applications, and the future research direction.",

    "abstract": "The research progress in multimodal learning has grown rapidly over the last decade in several areas, especially in computer vision. The growing potential of multimodal data streams and deep learning algorithms has contributed to the increasing universality of deep multimodal learning. This involves the development of models capable of processing and analyzing the multimodal information uniformly. Unstructured real-world data can inherently take many forms, also known as modalities, often including visual and textual content. Extracting relevant patterns from this kind of data is still a motivating goal for researchers in deep learning. In this paper, we seek to improve the understanding of key concepts and algorithms of deep multimodal learning for the computer vision community by exploring how to generate deep models that consider the integration and combination of heterogeneous visual cues across sensory modalities. In particular, we summarize six perspectives from the current literature on deep multimodal learning, namely: multimodal data representation, multimodal fusion (i.e., both traditional and deep learning-based schemes), multitask learning, multimodal alignment, multimodal transfer learning, and zero-shot learning. We also survey current multimodal applications and present a collection of benchmark datasets for solving problems in various vision domains. Finally, we highlight the limitations and challenges of deep multimodal learning and provide insights and directions for future research.",

    "title": "Solving Inverse Problems in Medical Imaging with Score-Based Generative Models",
    "abstract": "Reconstructing medical images from partial measurements is an important inverse problem in Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Existing solutions based on machine learning typically train a model to directly map measurements to medical images, leveraging a training dataset of paired images and measurements. These measurements are typically synthesized from images using a fixed physical model of the measurement process, which hinders the generalization capability of models to unknown measurement processes. To address this issue, we propose a fully unsupervised technique for inverse problem solving, leveraging the recently introduced score-based generative models. Specifically, we first train a score-based generative model on medical images to capture their prior distribution. Given measurements and a physical model of the measurement process at test time, we introduce a sampling method to reconstruct an image consistent with both the prior and the observed measurements. Our method does not assume a fixed measurement process during training, and can thus be flexibly adapted to different measurement processes at test time. Empirically, we observe comparable or better performance to supervised learning techniques in several medical imaging tasks in CT and MRI, while demonstrating significantly better generalization to unknown measurement processes.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning (DL) has the potential to transform medical diagnostics. However, the diagnostic accuracy of DL is uncertain. Our aim was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of DL algorithms to identify pathology in medical imaging. Searches were conducted in Medline and EMBASE up to January 2020. We identified 11,921 studies, of which 503 were included in the systematic review. Eighty-two studies in ophthalmology, 82 in breast disease and 115 in respiratory disease were included for meta-analysis. Two hundred twenty-four studies in other specialities were included for qualitative review. Peer-reviewed studies that reported on the diagnostic accuracy of DL algorithms to identify pathology using medical imaging were included. Primary outcomes were measures of diagnostic accuracy, study design and reporting standards in the literature. Estimates were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. In ophthalmology, AUC\u2019s ranged between 0.933 and 1 for diagnosing diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration and glaucoma on retinal fundus photographs and optical coherence tomography. In respiratory imaging, AUC\u2019s ranged between 0.864 and 0.937 for diagnosing lung nodules or lung cancer on chest X-ray or CT scan. For breast imaging, AUC\u2019s ranged between 0.868 and 0.909 for diagnosing breast cancer on mammogram, ultrasound, MRI and digital breast tomosynthesis. Heterogeneity was high between studies and extensive variation in methodology, terminology and outcome measures was noted. This can lead to an overestimation of the diagnostic accuracy of DL algorithms on medical imaging. There is an immediate need for the development of artificial intelligence-specific EQUATOR guidelines, particularly STARD, in order to provide guidance around key issues in this field.",

    "abstract": "We propose a novel feature extraction approach for 3D facial expression recognition by incorporating non-rigid registration in face-model-free analysis, which in turn makes feasible data-driven, i.e., feature-model-free recognition of expressions. The resulting simplicity of feature representation is due to the fact that facial information is adapted to the input faces via shape model-free dense registration, and this provides a dynamic feature extraction mechanism. This approach eliminates the necessity of complex feature representations as required in the case of static feature extraction methods, where the complexity arises from the necessity to model the local context; higher degree of complexity persists in deep feature hier- archies enabled by end-to-end learning on large-scale datasets. Face-model-free recognition implies inde-pendence from limitations and biases due to committed face models, bypassing complications of model \ufb01tting, and avoiding the burden of manual model construction. We show via information gain maps that non-rigid registration enables extraction of highly informative features, as it provides invariance to local- shifts due to physiognomy (subject invariance) and residual pose misalignments; in addition, it allows estimation of local correspondences of expressions. To maximize the recognition rate, we use the strat- egy of employing a rich but computationally manageable set of local correspondence structures, and to this effect we propose a framework to optimally select multiple registration references. Our features are re-sampled surface curvature values at individual coordinates which are chosen per expression-class and per reference pair. We show the superior performance of our novel dynamic feature extraction approach on three distinct recognition problems, namely, action unit detection, basic expression recognition, and emotion dimension recognition.",

    "abstract": "Computer applications have considerably shifted from single data processing to machine learning in recent years due to the accessibility and availability of massive volumes of data obtained through the internet and various sources. Machine learning is automating human assistance by training an algorithm on relevant data. Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement Learning are the three fundamental categories of machine learning techniques. In this paper, we have discussed the different learning styles used in the field of Computer vision, Deep Learning, Neural networks, and machine learning. Some of the most recent applications of machine learning in computer vision include object identification, object classification, and extracting usable information from images, graphic documents, and videos. Some machine learning techniques frequently include zero-shot learning, active learning, contrastive learning, self-supervised learning, life-long learning, semi-supervised learning, ensemble learning, sequential learning, and multi-view learning used in computer vision until now. There is a lack of systematic reviews about all learning styles. This paper presents literature analysis of how different machine learning styles evolved in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for computer vision. This research examines and evaluates machine learning applications in computer vision and future forecasting. This paper will be helpful for researchers working with learning styles as it gives a deep insight into future directions.",

While much work has been performed on potential use cases, there are currently no CV tools widely used for diagnostic or therapeutic applications in surgery.

    "abstract": "Algorithmic fairness is frequently motivated in terms of a trade-off in which overall performance is decreased so as to improve performance on disadvantaged groups where the algorithm would otherwise be less accurate. Contrary to this, we find that applying existing fairness approaches to computer vision improve fairness by degrading the performance of classifiers across all groups (with increased degradation on the best performing groups). Extending the bias-variance decomposition for classification to fairness, we theoretically explain why the majority of fairness methods designed for low capacity models should not be used in settings involving high-capacity models, a scenario common to computer vision. We corroborate this analysis with extensive experimental support that shows that many of the fairness heuristics used in computer vision also degrade performance on the most disadvantaged groups. Building on these insights, we propose an adaptive augmentation strategy that, uniquely, of all methods tested, improves performance for the disadvantaged groups.",

Weed plays a vital role in influencing crop productivity. The wastage and pollution of farmland's natural atmosphere instigated by full coverage chemical herbicide spraying are increased. Since the proper identification of weeds from crops helps to reduce the usage of herbicide and improve productivity, this study presents a novel computer vision and deep learning based weed detection and classification (CVDL-WDC) model for precision agriculture. The proposed CVDL-WDC technique intends to properly discriminate the plants as well as weeds. The proposed CVDL-WDC technique involves two processes namely multiscale Faster RCNN based object detection and optimal extreme learning machine (ELM) based weed classification. The parameters of the ELM model are optimally adjusted by the use of farmland fertility optimization (FFO) algorithm. A comprehensive simulation analysis of the CVDL-WDC technique against benchmark dataset reported the enhanced outcomes over its recent approaches interms of several measures.",

Digital programmable metasurface (DPM) may offer an intelligent and efficient solution owing to its powerful and flexible controls of electromagnetic waves and advantages of lower cost, less complexity and smaller size than the traditional antenna array. Here, we report an intelligent metasurface system to perform target tracking and wireless communications, in which computer vision integrated with a convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to automatically detect the locations of moving targets, and the dual-polarized DPM integrated with a pre-trained artificial neural network (ANN) serves to realize the smart beam tracking and wireless communications. Three groups of experiments are conducted for demonstrating the intelligent system: detection\u00a0and\u00a0identification of moving targets, detection of radio-frequency signals, and real-time wireless communications. The proposed method sets the stage for an integrated implementation of target identification, radio environment tracking, and wireless communications. This strategy opens up an avenue for intelligent wireless networks and self-adaptive systems. The authors present an intelligent metasurface system that uses a target detection algorithm combined with a depth camera, to automatically detect the position of moving targets and achieve real-time wireless communications. The system can operate for multiple targets in limited ambient light, outdoor and other realistic environments.",

    "title": "A Real-Time Computer Vision Based Approach to Detection and Classification of Traffic Incidents",
    "abstract": "To constructively ameliorate and enhance traffic safety measures in Saudi Arabia, a prolific number of AI (Artificial Intelligence) traffic surveillance technologies have emerged, including Saher, throughout the past years. However, rapidly detecting a vehicle incident can play a cardinal role in ameliorating the response speed of incident management, which in turn minimizes road injuries that have been induced by the accident\u2019s occurrence. To attain a permeating effect in increasing the entailed demand for road traffic security and safety, this paper presents a real-time traffic incident detection and alert system that is based on a computer vision approach. The proposed framework consists of three models, each of which is integrated within a prototype interface to fully visualize the system\u2019s overall architecture. To begin, the vehicle detection and tracking model utilized the YOLOv5 object detector with the DeepSORT tracker to detect and track the vehicles\u2019 movements by allocating a unique identification number (ID) to each vehicle. This model attained a mean average precision (mAP) of 99.2%. Second, a traffic accident and severity classification model attained a mAP of 83.3% while utilizing the YOLOv5 algorithm to accurately detect and classify an accident\u2019s severity level, sending an immediate alert message to the nearest hospital if a severe accident has taken place. Finally, the ResNet152 algorithm was utilized to detect the ignition of a fire following the accident\u2019s occurrence; this model achieved an accuracy rate of 98.9%, with an automated alert being sent to the fire station if this perilous event occurred. This study employed an innovative parallel computing technique for reducing the overall complexity and inference time of the AI-based system to run the proposed system in a concurrent and parallel manner.",

    "title": "Transfusion: Understanding Transfer Learning for Medical Imaging",
    "abstract": "Transfer learning from natural image datasets, particularly ImageNet, using standard large models and corresponding pretrained weights has become a de-facto method for deep learning applications to medical imaging. However, there are fundamental differences in data sizes, features and task specifications between natural image classification and the target medical tasks, and there is little understanding of the effects of transfer. In this paper, we explore properties of transfer learning for medical imaging. A performance evaluation on two large scale medical imaging tasks shows that surprisingly, transfer offers little benefit to performance, and simple, lightweight models can perform comparably to ImageNet architectures. Investigating the learned representations and features, we find that some of the differences from transfer learning are due to the over-parametrization of standard models rather than sophisticated feature reuse. We isolate where useful feature reuse occurs, and outline the implications for more efficient model exploration. We also explore feature independent benefits of transfer arising from weight scalings.",

    "abstract": "Importance\nMedical imaging increased rapidly from 2000 to 2006, but trends in recent years have not been analyzed.\n\n\nObjective\nTo evaluate recent trends in medical imaging.\n\n\nDesign, Setting, and Participants\nRetrospective cohort study of patterns of medical imaging between 2000 and 2016 among 16 million to 21 million patients enrolled annually in 7 US integrated and mixed-model insurance health care systems and for individuals receiving care in Ontario, Canada.\n\n\nExposures\nCalendar year and country (United States vs Canada).\n\n\nMain Outcomes and Measures\nUse of computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound, and nuclear medicine imaging. Annual and relative imaging rates by imaging modality, country, and age (children [<18 years], adults [18-64 years], and older adults [\u226565 years]).\n\n\nResults\nOverall, 135\u202f774\u202f532 imaging examinations were included; 5\u202f439\u202f874 (4%) in children, 89\u202f635\u202f312 (66%) in adults, and 40\u202f699\u202f346 (30%) in older adults. Among adults and older adults, imaging rates were significantly higher in 2016 vs 2000 for all imaging modalities other than nuclear medicine. For example, among older adults, CT imaging rates were 428 per 1000 person-years in 2016 vs 204 per 1000 in 2000 in US health care systems and 409 per 1000 vs 161 per 1000 in Ontario; for MRI, 139 per 1000 vs 62 per 1000 in the United States and 89 per 1000 vs 13 per 1000 in Ontario; and for ultrasound, 495 per 1000 vs 324 per 1000 in the United States and 580 per 1000 vs 332 per 1000 in Ontario. Annual growth in imaging rates among US adults and older adults slowed over time for CT (from an 11.6% annual percentage increase among adults and 9.5% among older adults in 2000-2006 to 3.7% among adults in 2013-2016 and 5.2% among older adults in 2014-2016) and for MRI (from 11.4% in 2000-2004 in adults and 11.3% in 2000-2005 in older adults to 1.3% in 2007-2016 in adults and 2.2% in 2005-2016 in older adults). Patterns in Ontario were similar. Among children, annual growth for CT stabilized or declined (United States: from 10.1% in 2000-2005 to 0.8% in 2013-2016; Ontario: from 3.3% in 2000-2006 to -5.3% in 2006-2016), but patterns for MRI were similar to adults. Changes in annual growth in ultrasound were smaller among adults and children in the United States and Ontario compared with CT and MRI. Nuclear medicine imaging declined in adults and children after 2006.\n\n\nConclusions and Relevance\nFrom 2000 to 2016 in 7 US integrated and mixed-model health care systems and in Ontario, rates of CT and MRI use continued to increase among adults, but at a slower pace in more recent years. In children, imaging rates continued to increase except for CT, which stabilized or declined in more recent periods. Whether the observed imaging utilization was appropriate or was associated with improved patient outcomes is unknown.",

    "title": "Deep Learning Predicts Lung Cancer Treatment Response from Serial Medical Imaging",
    "abstract": "Purpose: Tumors are continuously evolving biological systems, and medical imaging is uniquely positioned to monitor changes throughout treatment. Although qualitatively tracking lesions over space and time may be trivial, the development of clinically relevant, automated radiomics methods that incorporate serial imaging data is far more challenging. In this study, we evaluated deep learning networks for predicting clinical outcomes through analyzing time series CT images of patients with locally advanced non\u2013small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Experimental Design: Dataset A consists of 179 patients with stage III NSCLC treated with definitive chemoradiation, with pretreatment and posttreatment CT images at 1, 3, and 6 months follow-up (581 scans). Models were developed using transfer learning of convolutional neural networks (CNN) with recurrent neural networks (RNN), using single seed-point tumor localization. Pathologic response validation was performed on dataset B, comprising 89 patients with NSCLC treated with chemoradiation and surgery (178 scans). Results: Deep learning models using time series scans were significantly predictive of survival and cancer-specific outcomes (progression, distant metastases, and local-regional recurrence). Model performance was enhanced with each additional follow-up scan into the CNN model (e.g., 2-year overall survival: AUC = 0.74, P < 0.05). The models stratified patients into low and high mortality risk groups, which were significantly associated with overall survival [HR = 6.16; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.17\u201317.44; P < 0.001]. The model also significantly predicted pathologic response in dataset B (P = 0.016). Conclusions: We demonstrate that deep learning can integrate imaging scans at multiple timepoints to improve clinical outcome predictions. AI-based noninvasive radiomics biomarkers can have a significant impact in the clinic given their low cost and minimal requirements for human input.",

    "title": "Hidden stratification causes clinically meaningful failures in machine learning for medical imaging",
    "abstract": "Machine learning models for medical image analysis often suffer from poor performance on important subsets of a population that are not identified during training or testing. For example, overall performance of a cancer detection model may be high, but the model may still consistently miss a rare but aggressive cancer subtype. We refer to this problem as hidden stratification, and observe that it results from incompletely describing the meaningful variation in a dataset. While hidden stratification can substantially reduce the clinical efficacy of machine learning models, its effects remain difficult to measure. In this work, we assess the utility of several possible techniques for measuring hidden stratification effects, and characterize these effects both via synthetic experiments on the CIFAR-100 benchmark dataset and on multiple real-world medical imaging datasets. Using these measurement techniques, we find evidence that hidden stratification can occur in unidentified imaging subsets with low prevalence, low label quality, subtle distinguishing features, or spurious correlates, and that it can result in relative performance differences of over 20% on clinically important subsets. Finally, we discuss the clinical implications of our findings, and suggest that evaluation of hidden stratification should be a critical component of any machine learning deployment in medical imaging.",

Along with worked clinical examples, we highlight the importance of establishing the causal relationship between images and their annotations, and offer step-by-step recommendations for future studies. Scarcity of high-quality annotated data and mismatch between the development dataset and the target environment are two of the main challenges in developing predictive tools from medical imaging.

In this work, we examine the blockchain concept, which enables parties to establish consensus without relying on a central authority. We develop a framework for cross-domain image sharing that uses a blockchain as a distributed data store to establish a ledger of radiological studies and patient-defined access permissions. The blockchain framework is shown to eliminate third-party access to protected health information, satisfy many criteria of an interoperable health system, and readily generalize to domains beyond medical imaging. Relative drawbacks of the framework include the complexity of the privacy and security models and an unclear regulatory environment. Ultimately, the large-scale feasibility of such an approach remains to be demonstrated and will depend on a number of factors which we discuss in detail.",

Corresponding multimodal image analysis and ensemble learning schemes have seen rapid growth and bring unique value to medical applications. Motivated by the recent success of applying deep learning methods to medical image processing, we first propose an algorithmic architecture for supervised multimodal image analysis with cross-modality fusion at the feature learning level, classifier level, and decision-making level. We then design and implement an image segmentation system based on deep convolutional neural networks to contour the lesions of soft tissue sarcomas using multimodal images, including those from magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, and positron emission tomography. The network trained with multimodal images shows superior performance compared to networks trained with single-modal images. For the task of tumor segmentation, performing image fusion within the network (i.e., fusing at convolutional or fully connected layers) is generally better than fusing images at the network output (i.e., voting). This paper provides empirical guidance for the design and application of multimodal image analysis.",

Key research priorities include: 1, new image reconstruction methods that efficiently produce images suitable for human interpretation from source data; 2, automated image labeling and annotation methods, including information extraction from the imaging report, electronic phenotyping, and prospective structured image reporting; 3, new machine learning methods for clinical imaging data, such as tailored, pretrained model architectures, and federated machine learning methods; 4, machine learning methods that can explain the advice they provide to human users (so-called explainable artificial intelligence); and 5, validated methods for image de-identification and data sharing to facilitate wide availability of clinical imaging data sets. This research roadmap is intended to identify and prioritize these needs for academic research laboratories, funding agencies, professional societies, and industry.",

AI is widely used and getting increasingly popular in the medical imaging of the liver, including radiology, ultrasound, and nuclear medicine. AI can assist physicians to make more accurate and reproductive imaging diagnosis and also reduce the physicians\u2019 workload. This article illustrates basic technical knowledge about AI, including traditional machine learning and deep learning algorithms, especially convolutional neural networks, and their clinical application in the medical imaging of liver diseases, such as detecting and evaluating focal liver lesions, facilitating treatment, and predicting liver treatment response. We conclude that machine-assisted medical services will be a promising solution for future liver medical care. Lastly, we discuss the challenges and future directions of clinical application of deep learning techniques.",

The power of DL lies in the fact that it tries to imitate the activities of neurons in the neocortex of human brain where the thought process takes place. Therefore, like the brain, it tries to learn and recognize patterns in the form of digital images. This power is built on the depth of many layers of computing neurons backed by high power processors and graphics processing units (GPUs) easily available today. In the current scenario, we have provided detailed survey of various types of DL systems available today, and specifically, we have concentrated our efforts on current applications of DL in medical imaging. We have also focused our efforts on explaining the readers the rapid transition of technology from machine learning to DL and have tried our best in reasoning this paradigm shift. Further, a detailed analysis of complexities involved in this shift and possible benefits accrued by the users and developers.",

    "abstract": "Agriculture has always been an important economic and social sector for humans. Fruit production is especially essential, with a great demand from all households. Therefore, the use of innovative technologies is of vital importance for the agri-food sector. Currently artificial intelligence is one very important technological tool widely used in modern society. Particularly, Deep Learning (DL) has several applications due to its ability to learn robust representations from images. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is the main DL architecture for image classification. Based on the great attention that CNNs have had in the last years, we present a review of the use of CNN applied to different automatic processing tasks of fruit images: classification, quality control, and detection. We observe that in the last two years (2019\u20132020), the use of CNN for fruit recognition has greatly increased obtaining excellent results, either by using new models or with pre-trained networks for transfer learning. It is worth noting that different types of images are used in datasets according to the task performed. Besides, this article presents the fundamentals, tools, and two examples of the use of CNNs for fruit sorting and quality control.",

The spherical viewing range of 360\u00b0 video/image accounts for huge data, which pose the challenges to 360\u00b0 video/image processing in solving the bottleneck of storage, transmission, etc. Accordingly, the recent years have witnessed the explosive emergence of works on 360\u00b0 video/image processing. In this article, we review the state-of-the-art works on 360\u00b0 video/image processing from the aspects of perception, assessment and compression. First, this article reviews both datasets and visual attention modelling approaches for 360\u00b0 video/image. Second, we survey the related works on both subjective and objective visual quality assessment (VQA) of 360\u00b0 video/image. Third, we overview the compression approaches for 360\u00b0 video/image, which either utilize the spherical characteristics or visual attention models.

    "abstract": "Using large, multi-national datasets for high-performance medical imaging AI systems requires innovation in privacy-preserving machine learning so models can train on sensitive data without requiring data transfer. Here we present PriMIA (Privacy-preserving Medical Image Analysis), a free, open-source software framework for differentially private, securely aggregated federated learning and encrypted inference on medical imaging data. We test PriMIA using a real-life case study in which an expert-level deep convolutional neural network classifies paediatric chest X-rays; the resulting model\u2019s classification performance is on par with locally, non-securely trained models. We theoretically and empirically evaluate our framework\u2019s performance and privacy guarantees, and demonstrate that the protections provided prevent the reconstruction of usable data by a gradient-based model inversion attack. Finally, we successfully employ the trained model in an end-to-end encrypted remote inference scenario using secure multi-party computation to prevent the disclosure of the data and the model. Gaining access to medical data to train AI applications can present problems due to patient privacy or proprietary interests. A way forward can be privacy-preserving federated learning schemes. Kaissis, Ziller and colleagues demonstrate here their open source framework for privacy-preserving medical image analysis in a remote inference scenario.",

Nonetheless, there is a lack of systematic survey articles on state-of-the-art (SoTA) computer vision techniques, especially deep learning models, developed to tackle these problems. This article first introduces the sensing systems employed for 2-D and 3-D road data acquisition, including camera(s), laser scanners and Microsoft Kinect. It then comprehensively reviews the SoTA computer vision algorithms, including (1) classical 2-D image processing, (2) 3-D point cloud modelling and segmentation and (3) machine/deep learning, developed for road pothole detection. The article also discusses the existing challenges and future development trends of computer vision-based road pothole detection approaches: classical 2-D image processing-based and 3-D point cloud modelling and segmentation-based approaches have already become history; and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated compelling road pothole detection results and are promising to break the bottleneck with future advances in self/un-supervised learning for multi-modal semantic segmentation. We believe that this survey can serve as practical guidance for developing the next-generation road condition assessment systems.",

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained momentum in graph representation learning and boosted the state of the art in a variety of areas, such as data mining (e.g., social network analysis and recommender systems), computer vision (e.g., object detection and point cloud learning), and natural language processing (e.g., relation extraction and sequence learning), to name a few. With the emergence of Transformers in natural language processing and computer vision, graph Transformers embed a graph structure into the Transformer architecture to overcome the limitations of local neighborhood aggregation while avoiding strict structural inductive biases. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of GNNs and graph Transformers in computer vision from a task-oriented perspective. Specifically, we divide their applications in computer vision into five categories according to the modality of input data, i.e., 2D natural images, videos, 3D data, vision + language, and medical images. In each category, we further divide the applications according to a set of vision tasks. Such a task-oriented taxonomy allows us to examine how each task is tackled by different GNN-based approaches and how well these approaches perform. Based on the necessary preliminaries, we provide the definitions and challenges of the tasks, in-depth coverage of the representative approaches, as well as discussions regarding insights, limitations, and future directions.",

    "abstract": "Development of computer vision algorithms using convolutional neural networks and deep learning has necessitated ever greater amounts of annotated and labelled data to produce high performance models. Large, public data sets have been instrumental in pushing forward computer vision by providing the data necessary for training. However, many computer vision applications cannot rely on general image data provided in the available public datasets to train models, instead requiring labelled image data that is not readily available in the public domain on a large scale. At the same time, acquiring such data from the real world can be difficult, costly to obtain, and manual labour intensive to label in large quantities. Because of this, synthetic image data has been pushed to the forefront as a potentially faster and cheaper alternative to collecting and annotating real data. This review provides general overview of types of synthetic image data, as categorised by synthesised output, common methods of synthesising different types of image data, existing applications and logical extensions, performance of synthetic image data in different applications and the associated difficulties in assessing data performance, and areas for further research.",

    "title": "A Computer Vision-Based Intelligent Fish Feeding System Using Deep Learning Techniques for Aquaculture",
    "abstract": "The decisions made regarding traditional fish feeding systems mainly depend on experience and simple time control. Most previous works have focused on image-based analysis of the leftover feed at the bottom of the pond to determine whether to continue or to stop feeding. However, the feasibility of such a method in an actual outdoor aquaculture pond is low. The main reason for this is that real outdoor aquaculture ponds have turbid water quality, small feed targets, interference from intense fish activity, overlapping images of fish and feed, etc. Therefore, image-based recognition is not easy to implement in actual outdoor aquaculture. To overcome this problem, this article proposes an automatic fish feeding system based on deep learning computer vision technology. In contrast to traditional computer-vision-based systems for recognizing fish feed underwater, the proposed system uses deep learning technology to recognize the size of the waves caused by fish eating feed to determine whether to continue or to stop feeding. Furthermore, several water quality sensors are adopted to assist in feeding decisions. As a result, the proposed system uses deep learning technology to recognize the size of the water waves caused by fish eating feed to determine whether to continue to cast feed or to stop feeding. Experimental results show that an accuracy of up to 93.2% can be achieved.",

    "abstract": "As artificial intelligence (AI) rapidly approaches human-level performance in medical imaging, it is crucial that it does not exacerbate or propagate healthcare disparities. Previous research established AI\u2019s capacity to infer demographic data from chest X-rays, leading to a key concern: do models using demographic shortcuts have unfair predictions across subpopulations? In this study, we conducted a thorough investigation into the extent to which medical AI uses demographic encodings, focusing on potential fairness discrepancies within both in-distribution training sets and external test sets. Our analysis covers three key medical imaging disciplines\u2014radiology, dermatology and ophthalmology\u2014and incorporates data from six global chest X-ray datasets. We confirm that medical imaging AI leverages demographic shortcuts in disease classification. Although correcting shortcuts algorithmically effectively addresses fairness gaps to create \u2018locally optimal\u2019 models within the original data distribution, this optimality is not true in new test settings. Surprisingly, we found that models with less encoding of demographic attributes are often most \u2018globally optimal\u2019, exhibiting better fairness during model evaluation in new test environments. Our work establishes best practices for medical imaging models that maintain their performance and fairness in deployments beyond their initial training contexts, underscoring critical considerations for AI clinical deployments across populations and sites.",

    "abstract": "Generative Adversarial Networks are a class of artificial intelligence algorithms that consist of a generator and a discriminator trained simultaneously through adversarial training. GANs have found crucial applications in various fields, including medical imaging. In healthcare, GANs contribute by generating synthetic medical images, enhancing data quality, and aiding in image segmentation, disease detection, and medical image synthesis. Their importance lies in their ability to generate realistic images, facilitating improved diagnostics, research, and training for medical professionals. Understanding its applications, algorithms, current advancements, and challenges is imperative for further advancement in the medical imaging domain. However, no study explores the recent state-of-the-art development of GANs in medical imaging. To overcome this research gap, in this extensive study, we began by exploring the vast array of applications of GANs in medical imaging, scrutinizing them within recent research. We then dive into the prevalent datasets and pre-processing techniques to enhance comprehension. Subsequently, an in-depth discussion of the GAN algorithms, elucidating their respective strengths and limitations, is provided. After that, we meticulously analyzed the results and experimental details of some recent cutting-edge research to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of the current development of GANs in medical imaging. Lastly, we discussed the diverse challenges encountered and future research directions to mitigate these concerns. This systematic review offers a complete overview of GANs in medical imaging, encompassing their application domains, models, state-of-the-art results analysis, challenges, and research directions, serving as a valuable resource for multidisciplinary studies.",

    "title": "Bias in artificial intelligence for medical imaging: fundamentals, detection, avoidance, mitigation, challenges, ethics, and prospects",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Although artificial intelligence (AI) methods hold promise for medical imaging-based prediction tasks, their integration into medical practice may present a double-edged sword due to bias (i.e., systematic errors). AI algorithms have the potential to mitigate cognitive biases in human interpretation, but extensive research has highlighted the tendency of AI systems to internalize biases within their model. This fact, whether intentional or not, may ultimately lead to unintentional consequences in the clinical setting, potentially compromising patient outcomes. This concern is particularly important in medical imaging, where AI has been more progressively and widely embraced than any other medical field. A comprehensive understanding of bias at each stage of the AI pipeline is therefore essential to contribute to developing AI solutions that are not only less biased but also widely applicable. This international collaborative review effort aims to increase awareness within the medical imaging community about the importance of proactively identifying and addressing AI bias to prevent its negative consequences from being realized later. The authors began with the fundamentals of bias by explaining its different definitions and delineating various potential sources. Strategies for detecting and identifying bias were then outlined, followed by a review of techniques for its avoidance and mitigation. Moreover, ethical dimensions, challenges encountered, and prospects were discussed.",

    "abstract": "Fine-tuning large pre-trained models is an effective transfer mechanism in NLP. However, in the presence of many downstream tasks, fine-tuning is parameter inefficient: an entire new model is required for every task. As an alternative, we propose transfer with adapter modules. Adapter modules yield a compact and extensible model; they add only a few trainable parameters per task, and new tasks can be added without revisiting previous ones. The parameters of the original network remain fixed, yielding a high degree of parameter sharing. To demonstrate adapter's effectiveness, we transfer the recently proposed BERT Transformer model to 26 diverse text classification tasks, including the GLUE benchmark. Adapters attain near state-of-the-art performance, whilst adding only a few parameters per task. On GLUE, we attain within 0.4% of the performance of full fine-tuning, adding only 3.6% parameters per task. By contrast, fine-tuning trains 100% of the parameters per task.",

    "abstract": "Recent progress in hardware and methodology for training neural networks has ushered in a new generation of large networks trained on abundant data. These models have obtained notable gains in accuracy across many NLP tasks. However, these accuracy improvements depend on the availability of exceptionally large computational resources that necessitate similarly substantial energy consumption. As a result these models are costly to train and develop, both financially, due to the cost of hardware and electricity or cloud compute time, and environmentally, due to the carbon footprint required to fuel modern tensor processing hardware. In this paper we bring this issue to the attention of NLP researchers by quantifying the approximate financial and environmental costs of training a variety of recently successful neural network models for NLP. Based on these findings, we propose actionable recommendations to reduce costs and improve equity in NLP research and practice.",

    "abstract": "Adversarial examples highlight model vulnerabilities and are useful for evaluation and interpretation. We define universal adversarial triggers: input-agnostic sequences of tokens that trigger a model to produce a specific prediction when concatenated to any input from a dataset. We propose a gradient-guided search over tokens which finds short trigger sequences (e.g., one word for classification and four words for language modeling) that successfully trigger the target prediction. For example, triggers cause SNLI entailment accuracy to drop from 89.94% to 0.55%, 72% of \u201cwhy\u201d questions in SQuAD to be answered \u201cto kill american people\u201d, and the GPT-2 language model to spew racist output even when conditioned on non-racial contexts. Furthermore, although the triggers are optimized using white-box access to a specific model, they transfer to other models for all tasks we consider. Finally, since triggers are input-agnostic, they provide an analysis of global model behavior. For instance, they confirm that SNLI models exploit dataset biases and help to diagnose heuristics learned by reading comprehension models.",

    "title": "A Survey on Recent Approaches for Natural Language Processing in Low-Resource Scenarios",
    "abstract": "Deep neural networks and huge language models are becoming omnipresent in natural language applications. As they are known for requiring large amounts of training data, there is a growing body of work to improve the performance in low-resource settings. Motivated by the recent fundamental changes towards neural models and the popular pre-train and fine-tune paradigm, we survey promising approaches for low-resource natural language processing. After a discussion about the different dimensions of data availability, we give a structured overview of methods that enable learning when training data is sparse. This includes mechanisms to create additional labeled data like data augmentation and distant supervision as well as transfer learning settings that reduce the need for target supervision. A goal of our survey is to explain how these methods differ in their requirements as understanding them is essential for choosing a technique suited for a specific low-resource setting. Further key aspects of this work are to highlight open issues and to outline promising directions for future research.",

    "abstract": "Transformer-based pretrained language models (T-PTLMs) have achieved great success in almost every NLP task. The evolution of these models started with GPT and BERT. These models are built on the top of transformers, self-supervised learning and transfer learning. Transformed-based PTLMs learn universal language representations from large volumes of text data using self-supervised learning and transfer this knowledge to downstream tasks. These models provide good background knowledge to downstream tasks which avoids training of downstream models from scratch. In this comprehensive survey paper, we initially give a brief overview of self-supervised learning. Next, we explain various core concepts like pretraining, pretraining methods, pretraining tasks, embeddings and downstream adaptation methods. Next, we present a new taxonomy of T-PTLMs and then give brief overview of various benchmarks including both intrinsic and extrinsic. We present a summary of various useful libraries to work with T-PTLMs. Finally, we highlight some of the future research directions which will further improve these models. We strongly believe that this comprehensive survey paper will serve as a good reference to learn the core concepts as well as to stay updated with the recent happenings in T-PTLMs.",

    "title": "Extracting social determinants of health from electronic health records using natural language processing: a systematic review",
    "abstract": "Abstract Objective Social determinants of health (SDoH) are nonclinical dispositions that impact patient health risks and clinical outcomes. Leveraging SDoH in clinical decision-making can potentially improve diagnosis, treatment planning, and patient outcomes. Despite increased interest in capturing SDoH in electronic health records (EHRs), such information is typically locked in unstructured clinical notes. Natural language processing (NLP) is the key technology to extract SDoH information from clinical text and expand its utility in patient care and research. This article presents a systematic review of the state-of-the-art NLP approaches and tools that focus on identifying and extracting SDoH data from unstructured clinical text in EHRs. Materials and Methods A broad literature search was conducted in February 2021 using 3 scholarly databases (ACL Anthology, PubMed, and Scopus) following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A total of 6402 publications were initially identified, and after applying the study inclusion criteria, 82 publications were selected for the final review. Results Smoking status (n\u2009=\u200927), substance use (n\u2009=\u200921), homelessness (n\u2009=\u200920), and alcohol use (n\u2009=\u200915) are the most frequently studied SDoH categories. Homelessness (n\u2009=\u20097) and other less-studied SDoH (eg, education, financial problems, social isolation and support, family problems) are mostly identified using rule-based approaches. In contrast, machine learning approaches are popular for identifying smoking status (n\u2009=\u200913), substance use (n\u2009=\u20099), and alcohol use (n\u2009=\u20099). Conclusion NLP offers significant potential to extract SDoH data from narrative clinical notes, which in turn can aid in the development of screening tools, risk prediction models, and clinical decision support systems.",

    "title": "A systematic review of natural language processing applied to radiology reports",
    "abstract": "Background Natural language processing (NLP) has a significant role in advancing healthcare and has been found to be key in extracting structured information from radiology reports. Understanding recent developments in NLP application to radiology is of significance but recent reviews on this are limited. This study systematically assesses and quantifies recent literature in NLP applied to radiology reports. Methods We conduct an automated literature search yielding 4836 results using automated filtering, metadata enriching steps and citation search combined with manual review. Our analysis is based on 21 variables including radiology characteristics, NLP methodology, performance, study, and clinical application characteristics. Results We present a comprehensive analysis of the 164 publications retrieved with publications in 2019 almost triple those in 2015. Each publication is categorised into one of 6 clinical application categories. Deep learning use increases in the period but conventional machine learning approaches are still prevalent. Deep learning remains challenged when data is scarce and there is little evidence of adoption into clinical practice. Despite 17% of studies reporting greater than 0.85 F1 scores, it is hard to comparatively evaluate these approaches given that most of them use different datasets. Only 14 studies made their data and 15 their code available with 10 externally validating results. Conclusions Automated understanding of clinical narratives of the radiology reports has the potential to enhance the healthcare process and we show that research in this field continues to grow. Reproducibility and explainability of models are important if the domain is to move applications into clinical use. More could be done to share code enabling validation of methods on different institutional data and to reduce heterogeneity in reporting of study properties allowing inter-study comparisons. Our results have significance for researchers in the field providing a systematic synthesis of existing work to build on, identify gaps, opportunities for collaboration and avoid duplication.",

    "title": "Brains and algorithms partially converge in natural language processing",
    "abstract": "Deep learning algorithms trained to predict masked words from large amount of text have recently been shown to generate activations similar to those of the human brain. However, what drives this similarity remains currently unknown. Here, we systematically compare a variety of deep language models to identify the computational principles that lead them to generate brain-like representations of sentences. Specifically, we analyze the brain responses to 400 isolated sentences in a large cohort of 102 subjects, each recorded for two hours with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and magnetoencephalography (MEG). We then test where and when each of these algorithms maps onto the brain responses. Finally, we estimate how the architecture, training, and performance of these models independently account for the generation of brain-like representations. Our analyses reveal two main findings. First, the similarity between the algorithms and the brain primarily depends on their ability to predict words from context. Second, this similarity reveals the rise and maintenance of perceptual, lexical, and compositional representations within each cortical region. Overall, this study shows that modern language algorithms partially converge towards brain-like solutions, and thus delineates a promising path to unravel the foundations of natural language processing. Charlotte Caucheteux and Jean-R\u00e9mi King examine the ability of transformer neural networks trained on word prediction tasks to fit representations in the human brain measured with fMRI and MEG. Their results provide further insight into the workings of transformer language models and their relevance to brain responses.",

    "title": "Natural Language Processing and Graph Theory: Making Sense of Imaging Records in a Novel Representation Frame",
    "abstract": "Background A concise visualization framework of related reports would increase readability and improve patient management. To this end, temporal referrals to prior comparative exams are an essential connection to previous exams in written reports. Due to unstructured narrative texts' variable structure and content, their extraction is hampered by poor computer readability. Natural language processing (NLP) permits the extraction of structured information from unstructured texts automatically and can serve as an essential input for such a novel visualization framework. Objective This study proposes and evaluates an NLP-based algorithm capable of extracting the temporal referrals in written radiology reports, applies it to all the radiology reports generated for 10 years, introduces a graphical representation of imaging reports, and investigates its benefits for clinical and research purposes. Methods In this single-center, university hospital, retrospective study, we developed a convolutional neural network capable of extracting the date of referrals from imaging reports. The model's performance was assessed by calculating precision, recall, and F1-score using an independent test set of 149 reports. Next, the algorithm was applied to our department's radiology reports generated from 2011 to 2021. Finally, the reports and their metadata were represented in a modulable graph. Results For extracting the date of referrals, the named-entity recognition (NER) model had a high precision of 0.93, a recall of 0.95, and an F1-score of 0.94. A total of 1,684,635 reports were included in the analysis. Temporal reference was mentioned in 53.3% (656,852/1,684,635), explicitly stated as not available in 21.0% (258,386/1,684,635), and omitted in 25.7% (317,059/1,684,635) of the reports. Imaging records can be visualized in a directed and modulable graph, in which the referring links represent the connecting arrows. Conclusions Automatically extracting the date of referrals from unstructured radiology reports using deep learning NLP algorithms is feasible. Graphs refined the selection of distinct pathology pathways, facilitated the revelation of missing comparisons, and enabled the query of specific referring exam sequences. Further work is needed to evaluate its benefits in clinics, research, and resource planning.",

    "title": "Literature Review of Qualitative Data with Natural Language Processing",
    "abstract": "Qualitative research techniques are frequently employed by scholars in the field of social sciences when investigating communities and their communication media. The proliferation of computer-mediated communications has resulted in a substantial volume of textual content. However, the process of coding this vast amount of information necessitates significant time and effort. This article examines the potential for automating specific elements of content analysis through the utilization of natural language processing (NLP) systems, which analyze text in human languages, with a focus on extracting theoretical evidence. In this study, we present a case analysis utilizing NLP to examine the effectiveness of NLP rules in qualitative analysis. Our findings indicate that the NLP rules demonstrated strong performance across multiple codes. The utilization of a NLP system in its current developmental stage has the potential to significantly minimize the text volume, which has to be evaluated using the human coder. This reduction could potentially result in a substantial increase in coding speed, potentially by a factor of ten or more. The research is considered groundbreaking as it pioneers the application of advanced NLP approach to evaluate qualitative data, making it one of the earliest studies in this domain.",

    "title": "Natural language processing for mental health interventions: a systematic review and research framework",
    "abstract": "Neuropsychiatric disorders pose a high societal cost, but their treatment is hindered by lack of objective outcomes and fidelity metrics. AI technologies and specifically Natural Language Processing (NLP) have emerged as tools to study mental health interventions (MHI) at the level of their constituent conversations. However, NLP\u2019s potential to address clinical and research challenges remains unclear. We therefore conducted a pre-registered systematic review of NLP-MHI studies using PRISMA guidelines (osf.io/s52jh) to evaluate their models, clinical applications, and to identify biases and gaps. Candidate studies (n\u2009=\u200919,756), including peer-reviewed AI conference manuscripts, were collected up to January 2023 through PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, Google Scholar, and ArXiv. A total of 102 articles were included to investigate their computational characteristics (NLP algorithms, audio features, machine learning pipelines, outcome metrics), clinical characteristics (clinical ground truths, study samples, clinical focus), and limitations. Results indicate a rapid growth of NLP MHI studies since 2019, characterized by increased sample sizes and use of large language models. Digital health platforms were the largest providers of MHI data. Ground truth for supervised learning models was based on clinician ratings ( n \u2009=\u200931), patient self-report ( n \u2009=\u200929) and annotations by raters ( n \u2009=\u200926). Text-based features contributed more to model accuracy than audio markers. Patients\u2019 clinical presentation ( n \u2009=\u200934), response to intervention ( n \u2009=\u200911), intervention monitoring ( n \u2009=\u200920), providers\u2019 characteristics ( n \u2009=\u200912), relational dynamics ( n \u2009=\u200914), and data preparation ( n \u2009=\u20094) were commonly investigated clinical categories. Limitations of reviewed studies included lack of linguistic diversity, limited reproducibility, and population bias. A research framework is developed and validated (NLPxMHI) to assist computational and clinical researchers in addressing the remaining gaps in applying NLP to MHI, with the goal of improving clinical utility, data access, and fairness.",

    "title": "An Empirical Evaluation of Prompting Strategies for Large Language Models in Zero-Shot Clinical Natural Language Processing: Algorithm Development and Validation Study",
    "abstract": "Background Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in natural language processing (NLP), especially in domains where labeled data are scarce or expensive, such as the clinical domain. However, to unlock the clinical knowledge hidden in these LLMs, we need to design effective prompts that can guide them to perform specific clinical NLP tasks without any task-specific training data. This is known as in-context learning, which is an art and science that requires understanding the strengths and weaknesses of different LLMs and prompt engineering approaches. Objective The objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of various prompt engineering techniques, including 2 newly introduced types\u2014heuristic and ensemble prompts, for zero-shot and few-shot clinical information extraction using pretrained language models. Methods This comprehensive experimental study evaluated different prompt types (simple prefix, simple cloze, chain of thought, anticipatory, heuristic, and ensemble) across 5 clinical NLP tasks: clinical sense disambiguation, biomedical evidence extraction, coreference resolution, medication status extraction, and medication attribute extraction. The performance of these prompts was assessed using 3 state-of-the-art language models: GPT-3.5 (OpenAI), Gemini (Google), and LLaMA-2 (Meta). The study contrasted zero-shot with few-shot prompting and explored the effectiveness of ensemble approaches. Results The study revealed that task-specific prompt tailoring is vital for the high performance of LLMs for zero-shot clinical NLP. In clinical sense disambiguation, GPT-3.5 achieved an accuracy of 0.96 with heuristic prompts and 0.94 in biomedical evidence extraction. Heuristic prompts, alongside chain of thought prompts, were highly effective across tasks. Few-shot prompting improved performance in complex scenarios, and ensemble approaches capitalized on multiple prompt strengths. GPT-3.5 consistently outperformed Gemini and LLaMA-2 across tasks and prompt types. Conclusions This study provides a rigorous evaluation of prompt engineering methodologies and introduces innovative techniques for clinical information extraction, demonstrating the potential of in-context learning in the clinical domain. These findings offer clear guidelines for future prompt-based clinical NLP research, facilitating engagement by non-NLP experts in clinical NLP advancements. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first works on the empirical evaluation of different prompt engineering approaches for clinical NLP in this era of generative artificial intelligence, and we hope that it will inspire and inform future research in this area.",

    "abstract": "State-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) models are trained on massive training corpora, and report a superlative performance on evaluation datasets. This survey delves into an important attribute of these datasets: the dialect of a language. Motivated by the performance degradation of NLP models for dialectal datasets and its implications for the equity of language technologies, we survey past research in NLP for dialects in terms of datasets, and approaches. We describe a wide range of NLP tasks in terms of two categories: natural language understanding (NLU) (for tasks such as dialect classification, sentiment analysis, parsing, and NLU benchmarks) and natural language generation (NLG) (for summarisation, machine translation, and dialogue systems). The survey is also broad in its coverage of languages which include English, Arabic, German, among others. We observe that past work in NLP concerning dialects goes deeper than mere dialect classification, and extends to several NLU and NLG tasks. For these tasks, we describe classical machine learning using statistical models, along with the recent deep learning-based approaches based on pre-trained language models. We expect that this survey will be useful to NLP researchers interested in building equitable language technologies by rethinking LLM benchmarks and model architectures.",

    "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed significant advances in reinforcement learning (RL), which has registered great success in solving various sequential decision-making problems in machine learning. Most of the successful RL applications, e.g., the games of Go and Poker, robotics, and autonomous driving, involve the participation of more than one single agent, which naturally fall into the realm of multi-agent RL (MARL), a domain with a relatively long history, and has recently re-emerged due to advances in single-agent RL techniques. Though empirically successful, theoretical foundations for MARL are relatively lacking in the literature. In this chapter, we provide a selective overview of MARL, with focus on algorithms backed by theoretical analysis. More specifically, we review the theoretical results of MARL algorithms mainly within two representative frameworks, Markov/stochastic games and extensive-form games, in accordance with the types of tasks they address, i.e., fully cooperative, fully competitive, and a mix of the two. We also introduce several significant but challenging applications of these algorithms. Orthogonal to the existing reviews on MARL, we highlight several new angles and taxonomies of MARL theory, including learning in extensive-form games, decentralized MARL with networked agents, MARL in the mean-field regime, (non-)convergence of policy-based methods for learning in games, etc. Some of the new angles extrapolate from our own research endeavors and interests. Our overall goal with this chapter is, beyond providing an assessment of the current state of the field on the mark, to identify fruitful future research directions on theoretical studies of MARL. We expect this chapter to serve as continuing stimulus for researchers interested in working on this exciting while challenging topic.",

    "abstract": "Model-free reinforcement learning (RL) can be used to learn effective policies for complex tasks, such as Atari games, even from image observations. However, this typically requires very large amounts of interaction -- substantially more, in fact, than a human would need to learn the same games. How can people learn so quickly? Part of the answer may be that people can learn how the game works and predict which actions will lead to desirable outcomes. In this paper, we explore how video prediction models can similarly enable agents to solve Atari games with fewer interactions than model-free methods. We describe Simulated Policy Learning (SimPLe), a complete model-based deep RL algorithm based on video prediction models and present a comparison of several model architectures, including a novel architecture that yields the best results in our setting. Our experiments evaluate SimPLe on a range of Atari games in low data regime of 100k interactions between the agent and the environment, which corresponds to two hours of real-time play. In most games SimPLe outperforms state-of-the-art model-free algorithms, in some games by over an order of magnitude.",

    "abstract": "We explore value-based solutions for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) tasks in the centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) regime popularized recently. However, VDN and QMIX are representative examples that use the idea of factorization of the joint action-value function into individual ones for decentralized execution. VDN and QMIX address only a fraction of factorizable MARL tasks due to their structural constraint in factorization such as additivity and monotonicity. In this paper, we propose a new factorization method for MARL, QTRAN, which is free from such structural constraints and takes on a new approach to transforming the original joint action-value function into an easily factorizable one, with the same optimal actions. QTRAN guarantees more general factorization than VDN or QMIX, thus covering a much wider class of MARL tasks than does previous methods. Our experiments for the tasks of multi-domain Gaussian-squeeze and modified predator-prey demonstrate QTRAN's superior performance with especially larger margins in games whose payoffs penalize non-cooperative behavior more aggressively.",

    "abstract": "In reinforcement learning (RL) research, it is common to assume access to direct online interactions with the environment. However in many real-world applications, access to the environment is limited to a fixed offline dataset of logged experience. In such settings, standard RL algorithms have been shown to diverge or otherwise yield poor performance. Accordingly, recent work has suggested a number of remedies to these issues. In this work, we introduce a general framework, behavior regularized actor critic (BRAC), to empirically evaluate recently proposed methods as well as a number of simple baselines across a variety of offline continuous control tasks. Surprisingly, we find that many of the technical complexities introduced in recent methods are unnecessary to achieve strong performance. Additional ablations provide insights into which design choices matter most in the offline RL setting.",

    "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning algorithms require large amounts of experience to learn an individual task. While in principle meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) algorithms enable agents to learn new skills from small amounts of experience, several major challenges preclude their practicality. Current methods rely heavily on on-policy experience, limiting their sample efficiency. The also lack mechanisms to reason about task uncertainty when adapting to new tasks, limiting their effectiveness in sparse reward problems. In this paper, we address these challenges by developing an off-policy meta-RL algorithm that disentangles task inference and control. In our approach, we perform online probabilistic filtering of latent task variables to infer how to solve a new task from small amounts of experience. This probabilistic interpretation enables posterior sampling for structured and efficient exploration. We demonstrate how to integrate these task variables with off-policy RL algorithms to achieve both meta-training and adaptation efficiency. Our method outperforms prior algorithms in sample efficiency by 20-100X as well as in asymptotic performance on several meta-RL benchmarks.",

    "abstract": "In many real-world settings, a team of agents must coordinate its behaviour while acting in a decentralised fashion. At the same time, it is often possible to train the agents in a centralised fashion where global state information is available and communication constraints are lifted. Learning joint action-values conditioned on extra state information is an attractive way to exploit centralised learning, but the best strategy for then extracting decentralised policies is unclear. Our solution is QMIX, a novel value-based method that can train decentralised policies in a centralised end-to-end fashion. QMIX employs a mixing network that estimates joint action-values as a monotonic combination of per-agent values. We structurally enforce that the joint-action value is monotonic in the per-agent values, through the use of non-negative weights in the mixing network, which guarantees consistency between the centralised and decentralised policies. To evaluate the performance of QMIX, we propose the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC) as a new benchmark for deep multi-agent reinforcement learning. We evaluate QMIX on a challenging set of SMAC scenarios and show that it significantly outperforms existing multi-agent reinforcement learning methods.",

Unlike prior approaches to RL that fit value functions or compute policy gradients, Decision Transformer simply outputs the optimal actions by leveraging a causally masked Transformer. By conditioning an autoregressive model on the desired return (reward), past states, and actions, our Decision Transformer model can generate future actions that achieve the desired return.

    "title": "Offline Reinforcement Learning with Implicit Q-Learning",
    "abstract": "Offline reinforcement learning requires reconciling two conflicting aims: learning a policy that improves over the behavior policy that collected the dataset, while at the same time minimizing the deviation from the behavior policy so as to avoid errors due to distributional shift. This trade-off is critical, because most current offline reinforcement learning methods need to query the value of unseen actions during training to improve the policy, and therefore need to either constrain these actions to be in-distribution, or else regularize their values. We propose an offline RL method that never needs to evaluate actions outside of the dataset, but still enables the learned policy to improve substantially over the best behavior in the data through generalization. The main insight in our work is that, instead of evaluating unseen actions from the latest policy, we can approximate the policy improvement step implicitly by treating the state value function as a random variable, with randomness determined by the action (while still integrating over the dynamics to avoid excessive optimism), and then taking a state conditional upper expectile of this random variable to estimate the value of the best actions in that state. This leverages the generalization capacity of the function approximator to estimate the value of the best available action at a given state without ever directly querying a Q-function with this unseen action. Our algorithm alternates between fitting this upper expectile value function and backing it up into a Q-function. Then, we extract the policy via advantage-weighted behavioral cloning. We dub our method implicit Q-learning (IQL). IQL demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance on D4RL, a standard benchmark for offline reinforcement learning. We also demonstrate that IQL achieves strong performance fine-tuning using online interaction after offline initialization.",

    "abstract": "Offline reinforcement learning (RL) defines the task of learning from a fixed batch of data. Due to errors in value estimation from out-of-distribution actions, most offline RL algorithms take the approach of constraining or regularizing the policy with the actions contained in the dataset. Built on pre-existing RL algorithms, modifications to make an RL algorithm work offline comes at the cost of additional complexity. Offline RL algorithms introduce new hyperparameters and often leverage secondary components such as generative models, while adjusting the underlying RL algorithm. In this paper we aim to make a deep RL algorithm work while making minimal changes. We find that we can match the performance of state-of-the-art offline RL algorithms by simply adding a behavior cloning term to the policy update of an online RL algorithm and normalizing the data. The resulting algorithm is a simple to implement and tune baseline, while more than halving the overall run time by removing the additional computational overhead of previous methods.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) is typically concerned with estimating stationary policies or single-step models, leveraging the Markov property to factorize problems in time. However, we can also view RL as a generic sequence modeling problem, with the goal being to produce a sequence of actions that leads to a sequence of high rewards. Viewed in this way, it is tempting to consider whether high-capacity sequence prediction models that work well in other domains, such as natural-language processing, can also provide effective solutions to the RL problem. To this end, we explore how RL can be tackled with the tools of sequence modeling, using a Transformer architecture to model distributions over trajectories and repurposing beam search as a planning algorithm. Framing RL as sequence modeling problem simplifies a range of design decisions, allowing us to dispense with many of the components common in offline RL algorithms. We demonstrate the flexibility of this approach across long-horizon dynamics prediction, imitation learning, goal-conditioned RL, and offline RL. Further, we show that this approach can be combined with existing model-free algorithms to yield a state-of-the-art planner in sparse-reward, long-horizon tasks.",

    "abstract": "Nuclear fusion using magnetic confinement, in particular in the tokamak configuration, is a promising path towards sustainable energy. A core challenge is to shape and maintain a high-temperature plasma within the tokamak vessel. This requires high-dimensional, high-frequency, closed-loop control using magnetic actuator coils, further complicated by the diverse requirements across a wide range of plasma configurations. In this work, we introduce a previously undescribed architecture for tokamak magnetic controller design that autonomously learns to command the full set of control coils. This architecture meets control objectives specified at a high level, at the same time satisfying physical and operational constraints. This approach has unprecedented flexibility and generality in problem specification and yields a notable reduction in design effort to produce new plasma configurations. We successfully produce and control a diverse set of plasma configurations on the Tokamak \u00e0 Configuration Variable1,2, including elongated, conventional shapes, as well as advanced configurations, such as negative triangularity and \u2018snowflake\u2019 configurations. Our approach achieves accurate tracking of the location, current and shape for these configurations. We also demonstrate sustained \u2018droplets\u2019 on TCV, in which two separate plasmas are maintained simultaneously within the vessel. This represents a notable advance for tokamak feedback control, showing the potential of reinforcement learning to accelerate research in the fusion domain, and is one of the most challenging real-world systems to which reinforcement learning has been applied. A newly designed control architecture uses deep reinforcement learning to learn to command the coils of a tokamak, and successfully stabilizes a wide variety of fusion plasma configurations.",

    "title": "Discovering faster matrix multiplication algorithms with reinforcement learning",
    "abstract": "Improving the efficiency of algorithms for fundamental computations can have a widespread impact, as it can affect the overall speed of a large amount of computations. Matrix multiplication is one such primitive task, occurring in many systems\u2014from neural networks to scientific computing routines. The automatic discovery of algorithms using machine learning offers the prospect of reaching beyond human intuition and outperforming the current best human-designed algorithms. However, automating the algorithm discovery procedure is intricate, as the space of possible algorithms is enormous. Here we report a deep reinforcement learning approach based on AlphaZero1 for discovering efficient and provably correct algorithms for the multiplication of arbitrary matrices. Our agent, AlphaTensor, is trained to play a single-player game where the objective is finding tensor decompositions within a finite factor space. AlphaTensor discovered algorithms that outperform the state-of-the-art complexity for many matrix sizes. Particularly relevant is the case of 4\u2009\u00d7\u20094 matrices in a finite field, where AlphaTensor\u2019s algorithm improves on Strassen\u2019s two-level algorithm for the first time, to our knowledge, since its discovery 50 years ago2. We further showcase the flexibility of AlphaTensor through different use-cases: algorithms with state-of-the-art complexity for structured matrix multiplication and improved practical efficiency by optimizing matrix multiplication for runtime on specific hardware. Our results highlight AlphaTensor\u2019s ability to accelerate the process of algorithmic discovery on a range of problems, and to optimize for different criteria. A reinforcement learning approach based on AlphaZero is used to discover efficient and provably correct algorithms for matrix multiplication, finding faster algorithms for a variety of matrix sizes.",

    "abstract": "Many potential applications of artificial intelligence involve making real-time decisions in physical systems while interacting with humans. Automobile racing represents an extreme example of these conditions; drivers must execute complex tactical manoeuvres to pass or block opponents while operating their vehicles at their traction limits1. Racing simulations, such as the PlayStation game Gran Turismo, faithfully reproduce the non-linear control challenges of real race cars while also encapsulating the complex multi-agent interactions. Here we describe how we trained agents for Gran Turismo that can compete with the world\u2019s best e-sports drivers. We combine state-of-the-art, model-free, deep reinforcement learning algorithms with mixed-scenario training to learn an integrated control policy that combines exceptional speed with impressive tactics. In addition, we construct a reward function that enables the agent to be competitive while adhering to racing\u2019s important, but under-specified, sportsmanship rules. We demonstrate the capabilities of our agent, Gran Turismo Sophy, by winning a head-to-head competition against four of the world\u2019s best Gran Turismo drivers. By describing how we trained championship-level racers, we demonstrate the possibilities and challenges of using these techniques to control complex dynamical systems in domains where agents must respect imprecisely defined human norms. Using the game Gran Turismo, an agent was trained with a combination of deep reinforcement learning algorithms and specialized training scenarios, demonstrating success against championship-level human racers.",

    "abstract": "Program synthesis or code generation aims to generate a program that satisfies a problem specification. Recent approaches using large-scale pretrained language models (LMs) have shown promising results, yet they have some critical limitations. In particular, they often follow a standard supervised fine-tuning procedure to train a code generation model only from the pairs of natural-language problem descriptions and ground-truth programs. Such paradigm largely ignores some important but potentially useful signals in the problem specification such as unit tests, which thus often results in poor performance when solving complex unseen coding tasks. To address the limitations, we propose\"CodeRL\", a new framework for program synthesis tasks through pretrained LMs and deep reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, during training, we treat the code-generating LM as an actor network, and introduce a critic network that is trained to predict the functional correctness of generated programs and provide dense feedback signals to the actor. During inference, we introduce a new generation procedure with a critical sampling strategy that allows a model to automatically regenerate programs based on feedback from example unit tests and critic scores. For the model backbones, we extended the encoder-decoder architecture of CodeT5 with enhanced learning objectives, larger model sizes, and better pretraining data. Our method not only achieves new SOTA results on the challenging APPS benchmark, but also shows strong zero-shot transfer capability with new SOTA results on the simpler MBPP benchmark.",

    "abstract": "A compelling use case of offline reinforcement learning (RL) is to obtain a policy initialization from existing datasets followed by fast online fine-tuning with limited interaction. However, existing offline RL methods tend to behave poorly during fine-tuning. In this paper, we devise an approach for learning an effective initialization from offline data that also enables fast online fine-tuning capabilities. Our approach, calibrated Q-learning (Cal-QL), accomplishes this by learning a conservative value function initialization that underestimates the value of the learned policy from offline data, while also being calibrated, in the sense that the learned Q-values are at a reasonable scale. We refer to this property as calibration, and define it formally as providing a lower bound on the true value function of the learned policy and an upper bound on the value of some other (suboptimal) reference policy, which may simply be the behavior policy. We show that offline RL algorithms that learn such calibrated value functions lead to effective online fine-tuning, enabling us to take the benefits of offline initializations in online fine-tuning. In practice, Cal-QL can be implemented on top of the conservative Q learning (CQL) for offline RL within a one-line code change. Empirically, Cal-QL outperforms state-of-the-art methods on 9/11 fine-tuning benchmark tasks that we study in this paper. Code and video are available at https://nakamotoo.github.io/Cal-QL",

    "abstract": "Most offline reinforcement learning (RL) methods suffer from the trade-off between improving the policy to surpass the behavior policy and constraining the policy to limit the deviation from the behavior policy as computing $Q$-values using out-of-distribution (OOD) actions will suffer from errors due to distributional shift. The recently proposed \\textit{In-sample Learning} paradigm (i.e., IQL), which improves the policy by quantile regression using only data samples, shows great promise because it learns an optimal policy without querying the value function of any unseen actions. However, it remains unclear how this type of method handles the distributional shift in learning the value function. In this work, we make a key finding that the in-sample learning paradigm arises under the \\textit{Implicit Value Regularization} (IVR) framework. This gives a deeper understanding of why the in-sample learning paradigm works, i.e., it applies implicit value regularization to the policy. Based on the IVR framework, we further propose two practical algorithms, Sparse $Q$-learning (SQL) and Exponential $Q$-learning (EQL), which adopt the same value regularization used in existing works, but in a complete in-sample manner. Compared with IQL, we find that our algorithms introduce sparsity in learning the value function, making them more robust in noisy data regimes. We also verify the effectiveness of SQL and EQL on D4RL benchmark datasets and show the benefits of in-sample learning by comparing them with CQL in small data regimes.",

    "abstract": "Modern Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms require estimates of the maximal Q-value, which are difficult to compute in continuous domains with an infinite number of possible actions. In this work, we introduce a new update rule for online and offline RL which directly models the maximal value using Extreme Value Theory (EVT), drawing inspiration from economics. By doing so, we avoid computing Q-values using out-of-distribution actions which is often a substantial source of error. Our key insight is to introduce an objective that directly estimates the optimal soft-value functions (LogSumExp) in the maximum entropy RL setting without needing to sample from a policy. Using EVT, we derive our \\emph{Extreme Q-Learning} framework and consequently online and, for the first time, offline MaxEnt Q-learning algorithms, that do not explicitly require access to a policy or its entropy. Our method obtains consistently strong performance in the D4RL benchmark, outperforming prior works by \\emph{10+ points} on the challenging Franka Kitchen tasks while offering moderate improvements over SAC and TD3 on online DM Control tasks.

    "abstract": "Preference-based reinforcement learning (RL) provides a framework to train agents using human preferences between two behaviors. However, preference-based RL has been challenging to scale since it requires a large amount of human feedback to learn a reward function aligned with human intent. In this paper, we present Preference Transformer, a neural architecture that models human preferences using transformers. Unlike prior approaches assuming human judgment is based on the Markovian rewards which contribute to the decision equally, we introduce a new preference model based on the weighted sum of non-Markovian rewards. We then design the proposed preference model using a transformer architecture that stacks causal and bidirectional self-attention layers. We demonstrate that Preference Transformer can solve a variety of control tasks using real human preferences, while prior approaches fail to work. We also show that Preference Transformer can induce a well-specified reward and attend to critical events in the trajectory by automatically capturing the temporal dependencies in human decision-making.

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) learns from preference signals, while standard Reinforcement Learning (RL) directly learns from reward signals. Preferences arguably contain less information than rewards, which makes preference-based RL seemingly more difficult. This paper theoretically proves that, for a wide range of preference models, we can solve preference-based RL directly using existing algorithms and techniques for reward-based RL, with small or no extra costs. Specifically, (1) for preferences that are drawn from reward-based probabilistic models, we reduce the problem to robust reward-based RL that can tolerate small errors in rewards; (2) for general arbitrary preferences where the objective is to find the von Neumann winner, we reduce the problem to multiagent reward-based RL which finds Nash equilibria for factored Markov games under a restricted set of policies. The latter case can be further reduce to adversarial MDP when preferences only depend on the final state. We instantiate all reward-based RL subroutines by concrete provable algorithms, and apply our theory to a large class of models including tabular MDPs and MDPs with generic function approximation. We further provide guarantees when K-wise comparisons are available.",

    "abstract": "From rearranging objects on a table to putting groceries into shelves, robots must plan precise action points to perform tasks accurately and reliably. In spite of the recent adoption of vision language models (VLMs) to control robot behavior, VLMs struggle to precisely articulate robot actions using language.

Using the pipeline, we train RoboPoint, a VLM that predicts image keypoint affordances given language instructions. Compared to alternative approaches, our method requires no real-world data collection or human demonstration, making it much more scalable to diverse environments and viewpoints. In addition, RoboPoint is a general model that enables several downstream applications such as robot navigation, manipulation, and augmented reality (AR) assistance. Our experiments demonstrate that RoboPoint outperforms state-of-the-art VLMs (GPT-4o) and visual prompting techniques (PIVOT) by 21.8% in the accuracy of predicting spatial affordance and by 30.5% in the success rate of downstream tasks.

    "abstract": "Background: Network analysis (NA) is an analytical tool that allows one to explore the map of connections and eventual dynamic influences among symptoms and other elements of mental disorders. In recent years, the use of NA in psychopathology has rapidly grown, which calls for a systematic and critical analysis of its clinical utility. Methods: Following PRISMA guidelines, a systematic review of published empirical studies applying NA in psychopathology, between 2010 and 2017, was conducted. We included the literature published in PubMed and PsycINFO using as keywords any combination of \u201cnetwork analysis\u201d with the terms \u201canxiety,\u201d \u201caffective disorders,\u201d \u201cdepression,\u201d \u201cschizophrenia,\u201d \u201cpsychosis,\u201d \u201cpersonality disorders,\u201d \u201csubstance abuse\u201d and \u201cpsychopathology.\u201d Results: The review showed that NA has been applied in a plethora of mental disorders in adults (i.e., 13 studies on anxiety disorders; 19 on mood disorders; 7 on psychosis; 1 on substance abuse; 1 on borderline personality disorder; 18 on the association of symptoms between disorders), and 6 on childhood and adolescence. Conclusions: A critical examination of the results of each study suggests that NA helps to identify, in an innovative way, important aspects of psychopathology like the centrality of the symptoms in a given disorder as well as the mutual dynamics among symptoms. Yet, despite these promising results, the clinical utility of NA is still uncertain as there are important limitations on the analytic procedures (e.g., reliability of indices), the type of data included (e.g., typically restricted to secondary analysis of already published data), and ultimately, the psychometric and clinical validity of the results.",

    "abstract": "Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents a heterogeneous group of malignancies consisting essentially of adenocarcinoma (ADC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Although the diagnosis and treatment of ADC and SCC have been greatly improved in recent decades, there is still an urgent need to identify accurate transcriptome profile associated with the histological subtypes of NSCLC. The present study aims to identify the key dysregulated pathways and genes involved in the development of lung ADC and SCC and to relate them with the clinical traits. The transcriptional changes between tumour and normal lung tissues were investigated by RNA-seq. Gene ontology (GO), canonical pathways analysis with the prediction of upstream regulators, and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to identify co-expressed modules and hub genes were used to explore the biological functions of the identified dysregulated genes. It was indicated that specific gene signatures differed significantly between ADC and SCC related to the distinct pathways. Of identified modules, four and two modules were the most related to clinical features in ADC and SCC, respectively. CTLA4, MZB1, NIP7, and BUB1B in ADC, as well as GNG11 and CCNB2 in SCC, are novel top hub genes in modules associated with tumour size, SUVmax, and recurrence-free survival. Our research provides a more effective understanding of the importance of biological pathways and the relationships between major genes in NSCLC in the perspective of searching for new molecular targets.",

    "abstract": "\nPurpose\nThe purpose of this paper is to identify and discuss the most important research areas on information sharing in supply chains and related risks, taking into account their evolution over time. This paper sheds light on what is happening today and what the trajectories for the future are, with particular respect to the implications for supply chain management.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nThe dynamic literature review method called Systematic Literature Network Analysis (SLNA) was adopted. It combines the Systematic Literature Review approach and bibliographic network analyses, and it relies on objective measures and algorithms to perform quantitative literature-based detection of emerging topics.\n\n\nFindings\nThe focus of the literature seems to be on threats that are internal to the extended supply chain rather than on external attacks, such as viruses, traditionally related to information technology (IT). The main arising risk appears to be the intentional or non-intentional leakage of information. Also, papers analyze the implications for information sharing coming from \u201csoft\u201d factors such as trust and collaboration among supply chain partners. Opportunities are also highlighted and include how information sharing can be leveraged to confront disruptions and increase resilience.\n\n\nResearch limitations/implications\nThe adopted methodology allows for providing an original perspective on the investigated topic, that is, how information sharing in supply chains and related risks are evolving over time because of the turbulent advances in technology.\n\n\nPractical implications\nEmergent and highly critical risks related to information sharing are highlighted to support the design of supply chain risks strategies. Also, critical areas to the development of \u201cbeyond-the-dyad\u201d initiatives to manage information sharing risks emerge. Opportunities coming from information sharing that are less known and exploited by companies are provided.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThis paper focuses on the supply chain perspective rather than the traditional IT-based view of information sharing. According to this perspective, this paper provides a dynamic representation of the literature on the investigated topic. This is an important contribution to the topic of information sharing in supply chains is continuously evolving and shaping new supply chain models.\n",

    "title": "Phylogenetic network analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes",
    "abstract": "Significance This is a phylogenetic network of SARS-CoV-2 genomes sampled from across the world. These genomes are closely related and under evolutionary selection in their human hosts, sometimes with parallel evolution events, that is, the same virus mutation emerges in two different human hosts. This makes character-based phylogenetic networks the method of choice for reconstructing their evolutionary paths and their ancestral genome in the human host. The network method has been used in around 10,000 phylogenetic studies of diverse organisms, and is mostly known for reconstructing the prehistoric population movements of humans and for ecological studies, but is less commonly employed in the field of virology. In a phylogenetic network analysis of 160 complete human severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) genomes, we find three central variants distinguished by amino acid changes, which we have named A, B, and C, with A being the ancestral type according to the bat outgroup coronavirus. The A and C types are found in significant proportions outside East Asia, that is, in Europeans and Americans. In contrast, the B type is the most common type in East Asia, and its ancestral genome appears not to have spread outside East Asia without first mutating into derived B types, pointing to founder effects or immunological or environmental resistance against this type outside Asia. The network faithfully traces routes of infections for documented coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases, indicating that phylogenetic networks can likewise be successfully used to help trace undocumented COVID-19 infection sources, which can then be quarantined to prevent recurrent spread of the disease worldwide.",

    "title": "COVID-19 and the 5G Conspiracy Theory: Social Network Analysis of Twitter Data",
    "abstract": "Background Since the beginning of December 2019, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has spread rapidly around the world, which has led to increased discussions across online platforms. These conversations have also included various conspiracies shared by social media users. Amongst them, a popular theory has linked 5G to the spread of COVID-19, leading to misinformation and the burning of 5G towers in the United Kingdom. The understanding of the drivers of fake news and quick policies oriented to isolate and rebate misinformation are keys to combating it. Objective The aim of this study is to develop an understanding of the drivers of the 5G COVID-19 conspiracy theory and strategies to deal with such misinformation. Methods This paper performs a social network analysis and content analysis of Twitter data from a 7-day period (Friday, March 27, 2020, to Saturday, April 4, 2020) in which the #5GCoronavirus hashtag was trending on Twitter in the United Kingdom. Influential users were analyzed through social network graph clusters. The size of the nodes were ranked by their betweenness centrality score, and the graph\u2019s vertices were grouped by cluster using the Clauset-Newman-Moore algorithm. The topics and web sources used were also examined. Results Social network analysis identified that the two largest network structures consisted of an isolates group and a broadcast group. The analysis also revealed that there was a lack of an authority figure who was actively combating such misinformation. Content analysis revealed that, of 233 sample tweets, 34.8% (n=81) contained views that 5G and COVID-19 were linked, 32.2% (n=75) denounced the conspiracy theory, and 33.0% (n=77) were general tweets not expressing any personal views or opinions. Thus, 65.2% (n=152) of tweets derived from nonconspiracy theory supporters, which suggests that, although the topic attracted high volume, only a handful of users genuinely believed the conspiracy. This paper also shows that fake news websites were the most popular web source shared by users; although, YouTube videos were also shared. The study also identified an account whose sole aim was to spread the conspiracy theory on Twitter. Conclusions The combination of quick and targeted interventions oriented to delegitimize the sources of fake information is key to reducing their impact. Those users voicing their views against the conspiracy theory, link baiting, or sharing humorous tweets inadvertently raised the profile of the topic, suggesting that policymakers should insist in the efforts of isolating opinions that are based on fake news. Many social media platforms provide users with the ability to report inappropriate content, which should be used. This study is the first to analyze the 5G conspiracy theory in the context of COVID-19 on Twitter offering practical guidance to health authorities in how, in the context of a pandemic, rumors may be combated in the future.",

    "abstract": "Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are an emerging technology for future wireless communication. The vast majority of recent research on RIS has focused on system level optimizations. However, developing straightforward and tractable electromagnetic models that are suitable for RIS aided communication modeling remains an open issue. In this paper, we address this issue and derive communication models by using rigorous scattering parameter network analysis. We also propose new RIS architectures based on group and fully connected reconfigurable impedance networks that can adjust not only the phases but also the magnitudes of the impinging waves, which are more general and more efficient than conventional single connected reconfigurable impedance network that only adjusts the phases of the impinging waves. In addition, the scaling law of the received signal power of an RIS aided system with reconfigurable impedance networks is also derived. Compared with the single connected reconfigurable impedance network, our group and fully connected reconfigurable impedance network can increase the received signal power by up to 62%, or maintain the same received signal power with a number of RIS elements reduced by up to 21%. We also investigate the proposed architecture in deployments with distance-dependent pathloss and Rician fading channel, and show that the proposed group and fully connected reconfigurable impedance networks outperform the single connected case by up to 34% and 48%, respectively.",

Here we propose a new model, QA-GNN, which addresses the above challenges through two key innovations: (i) relevance scoring, where we use LMs to estimate the importance of KG nodes relative to the given QA context, and (ii) joint reasoning, where we connect the QA context and KG to form a joint graph, and mutually update their representations through graph-based message passing. We evaluate QA-GNN on the CommonsenseQA and OpenBookQA datasets, and show its improvement over existing LM and LM+KG models, as well as its capability to perform interpretable and structured reasoning, e.g., correctly handling negation in questions.",

    "abstract": "Graph-based fraud detection approaches have escalated lots of attention recently due to the abundant relational information of graph-structured data, which may be beneficial for the detection of fraudsters. However, the GNN-based algorithms could fare poorly when the label distribution of nodes is heavily skewed, and it is common in sensitive areas such as financial fraud, etc. To remedy the class imbalance problem of graph-based fraud detection, we propose a Pick and Choose Graph Neural Network (PC-GNN for short) for imbalanced supervised learning on graphs. First, nodes and edges are picked with a devised label-balanced sampler to construct sub-graphs for mini-batch training. Next, for each node in the sub-graph, the neighbor candidates are chosen by a proposed neighborhood sampler. Finally, information from the selected neighbors and different relations are aggregated to obtain the final representation of a target node. Experiments on both benchmark and real-world graph-based fraud detection tasks demonstrate that PC-GNN apparently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we propose BertGCN, a model that combines large scale pretraining and transductive learning for text classification. BertGCN constructs a heterogeneous graph over the dataset and represents documents as nodes using BERT representations. By jointly training the BERT and GCN modules within BertGCN, the proposed model is able to leverage the advantages of both worlds: large-scale pretraining which takes the advantage of the massive amount of raw data and transductive learning which jointly learns representations for both training data and unlabeled test data by propagating label influence through graph convolution. Experiments show that BertGCN achieves SOTA performances on a wide range of text classification datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/ZeroRin/BertGCN.",

    "title": "From Stars to Subgraphs: Uplifting Any GNN with Local Structure Awareness",
    "abstract": "Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are a common type of Graph Neural Network (GNN), in which each node's representation is computed recursively by aggregating representations (messages) from its immediate neighbors akin to a star-shaped pattern. MPNNs are appealing for being efficient and scalable, how-ever their expressiveness is upper-bounded by the 1st-order Weisfeiler-Lehman isomorphism test (1-WL). In response, prior works propose highly expressive models at the cost of scalability and sometimes generalization performance. Our work stands between these two regimes: we introduce a general framework to uplift any MPNN to be more expressive, with limited scalability overhead and greatly improved practical performance. We achieve this by extending local aggregation in MPNNs from star patterns to general subgraph patterns (e.g.,k-egonets):in our framework, each node representation is computed as the encoding of a surrounding induced subgraph rather than encoding of immediate neighbors only (i.e. a star). We choose the subgraph encoder to be a GNN (mainly MPNNs, considering scalability) to design a general framework that serves as a wrapper to up-lift any GNN. We call our proposed method GNN-AK(GNN As Kernel), as the framework resembles a convolutional neural network by replacing the kernel with GNNs. Theoretically, we show that our framework is strictly more powerful than 1&2-WL, and is not less powerful than 3-WL. We also design subgraph sampling strategies which greatly reduce memory footprint and improve speed while maintaining performance. Our method sets new state-of-the-art performance by large margins for several well-known graph ML tasks; specifically, 0.08 MAE on ZINC,74.79% and 86.887% accuracy on CIFAR10 and PATTERN respectively.",

    "abstract": "The representation learning on textual graph is to generate low-dimensional embeddings for the nodes based on the individual textual features and the neighbourhood information. Recent breakthroughs on pretrained language models and graph neural networks push forward the development of corresponding techniques. The existing works mainly rely on the cascaded model architecture: the textual features of nodes are independently encoded by language models at first; the textual embeddings are aggregated by graph neural networks afterwards. However, the above architecture is limited due to the independent modeling of textual features. In this work, we propose GraphFormers, where layerwise GNN components are nested alongside the transformer blocks of language models. With the proposed architecture, the text encoding and the graph aggregation are fused into an iterative workflow, {making} each node's semantic accurately comprehended from the global perspective. In addition, a {progressive} learning strategy is introduced, where the model is successively trained on manipulated data and original data to reinforce its capability of integrating information on graph. Extensive evaluations are conducted on three large-scale benchmark datasets, where GraphFormers outperform the SOTA baselines with comparable running efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Social recommendation aims to fuse social links with user-item interactions to alleviate the cold-start problem for rating prediction. Recent developments of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) motivate endeavors to design GNN-based social recommendation frameworks to aggregate both social and user-item interaction information simultaneously. However, most existing methods neglect the social inconsistency problem, which intuitively suggests that social links are not necessarily consistent with the rating prediction process. Social inconsistency can be observed from both context-level and relation-level. Therefore, we intend to empower the GNN model with the ability to tackle the social inconsistency problem. We propose to sample consistent neighbors by relating sampling probability with consistency scores between neighbors. Besides, we employ the relation attention mechanism to assign consistent relations with high importance factors for aggregation. Experiments on two real-world datasets verify the model effectiveness.",

    "abstract": "A graph neural network (GNN) enables deep learning on structured graph data. There are two major GNN training obstacles: 1) it relies on high-end servers with many GPUs which are expensive to purchase and maintain, and 2) limited memory on GPUs cannot scale to today's billion-edge graphs. This paper presents Dorylus: a distributed system for training GNNs. Uniquely, Dorylus can take advantage of serverless computing to increase scalability at a low cost. The key insight guiding our design is computation separation. Computation separation makes it possible to construct a deep, bounded-asynchronous pipeline where graph and tensor parallel tasks can fully overlap, effectively hiding the network latency incurred by Lambdas. With the help of thousands of Lambda threads, Dorylus scales GNN training to billion-edge graphs. Currently, for large graphs, CPU servers offer the best performance-per-dollar over GPU servers. Just using Lambdas on top of CPU servers offers up to 2.75x more performance-per-dollar than training only with CPU servers. Concretely, Dorylus is 1.22x faster and 4.83x cheaper than GPU servers for massive sparse graphs. Dorylus is up to 3.8x faster and 10.7x cheaper compared to existing sampling-based systems.",

    "abstract": "Gaining structural insights into the protein-protein interactome is essential to understand biological phenomena and extract knowledge for rational drug design or protein engineering. We have previously developed DeepRank, a deep-learning framework to facilitate pattern learning from protein-protein interfaces using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) approaches. However, CNN is not rotation invariant and data augmentation is required to desensitize the network to the input data orientation which dramatically impairs the computation performance. Representing protein-protein complexes as atomic- or residue-scale rotation invariant graphs instead enables using graph neural networks (GNN) approaches, bypassing those limitations. We have developed DeepRank-GNN, a framework that converts protein-protein interfaces from PDB 3D coordinates files into graphs that are further provided to a pre-defined or user-defined GNN architecture to learn problem-specific interaction patterns. DeepRank-GNN is designed to be highly modularizable, easily customized, and is wrapped into a user-friendly python3 package. Here, we showcase DeepRank-GNN\u2019s performance for scoring docking models using a dedicated graph interaction neural network (GINet). We show that this graph-based model performs better than DeepRank, DOVE and HADDOCK scores and competes with iScore on the CAPRI score set. We show a significant gain in speed and storage requirement using DeepRank-GNN as compared to DeepRank. DeepRank-GNN is freely available from https://github.com/DeepRank/DeepRank-GNN.

    "abstract": "Abstract Integrated network analysis pipeline (iNAP) is an online analysis pipeline for generating and analyzing comprehensive ecological networks in microbiome studies. It is implemented in two sections, that is, network construction and network analysis, and integrates many open\u2010access tools. Network construction contains multiple feasible alternatives, including correlation\u2010based approaches (Pearson's correlation and Spearman's rank correlation along with random matrix theory, and sparse correlations for compositional data) and conditional dependence\u2010based methods (extended local similarity analysis and sparse inverse covariance estimation for ecological association inference), while network analysis provides topological structures at different levels and the potential effects of environmental factors on network structures. Considering the full workflow, from microbiome data set to network result, iNAP contains the molecular ecological network analysis pipeline and interdomain ecological network analysis pipeline (IDENAP), which correspond to the intradomain and interdomain associations of microbial species at multiple taxonomic levels. Here, we describe the detailed workflow by taking IDENAP as an example and show the comprehensive steps to assist researchers to conduct the relevant analyses using their own data sets. Afterwards, some auxiliary tools facilitating the pipeline are introduced to effectively aid in the switch from local analysis to online operations. Therefore, iNAP, as an easy\u2010to\u2010use platform that provides multiple network\u2010associated tools and approaches, can enable researchers to better understand the organization of microbial communities. iNAP is available at http://mem.rcees.ac.cn:8081 with free registration.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The network analysis has attracted increasing attention and interest from ecological academics, thus it is of great necessity to develop more convenient and powerful tools. For that reason, we have developed an R package, named \u201cggClusterNet,\u201d to complete and display the network analysis in an easier manner. In that package, ten network layout algorithms are designed to better display the modules of microbiome network (randomClusterG, PolygonClusterG, PolygonRrClusterG, ArtifCluster, randSNEClusterG, PolygonModsquareG, PolyRdmNotdCirG, model_Gephi.2, model_igraph, and model_maptree). For the convenience of the users, many functions related to microbial network analysis, such as corMicor(), net_properties(), node_properties(), ZiPiPlot(), random_Net_compate(), are integrated to complete the network mining. Furthermore, the pipeline function named network.2() and corBionetwork() are also added for the quick achievement of the network or bipartite network analysis as well as their in\u2010depth mining. The ggClusterNet is publicly available via GitHub (https://github.com/taowenmicro/ggClusterNet/) or Gitee (https://gitee.com/wentaomicro/ggClusterNet) for users' access.

    "abstract": "Mapping the connectome of the human brain using structural or functional connectivity has become one of the most pervasive paradigms for neuroimaging analysis. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) motivated from geometric deep learning have attracted broad interest due to their established power for modeling complex networked data. Despite their superior performance in many fields, there has not yet been a systematic study of how to design effective GNNs for brain network analysis. To bridge this gap, we present BrainGB, a benchmark for brain network analysis with GNNs. BrainGB standardizes the process by (1) summarizing brain network construction pipelines for both functional and structural neuroimaging modalities and (2) modularizing the implementation of GNN designs. We conduct extensive experiments on datasets across cohorts and modalities and recommend a set of general recipes for effective GNN designs on brain networks. To support open and reproducible research on GNN-based brain network analysis, we host the BrainGB website at https://braingb.us with models, tutorials, examples, as well as an out-of-box Python package. We hope that this work will provide useful empirical evidence and offer insights for future research in this novel and promising direction.",

    "abstract": "A large-scale dynamically weighted directed network (DWDN) involving numerous entities and massive dynamic interaction is an essential data source in many big-data-related applications, like in a terminal interaction pattern analysis system (TIPAS). It can be represented by a high-dimensional and incomplete (HDI) tensor whose entries are mostly unknown. Yet such an HDI tensor contains a wealth knowledge regarding various desired patterns like potential links in a DWDN. A latent factorization-of-tensors (LFT) model proves to be highly efficient in extracting such knowledge from an HDI tensor, which is commonly achieved via a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) solver. However, an SGD-based LFT model suffers from slow convergence that impairs its efficiency on large-scale DWDNs. To address this issue, this work proposes a proportional-integral-derivative (PID)-incorporated LFT model. It constructs an adjusted instance error based on the PID control principle, and then substitutes it into an SGD solver to improve the convergence rate. Empirical studies on two DWDNs generated by a real TIPAS show that compared with state-of-the-art models, the proposed model achieves significant efficiency gain as well as highly competitive prediction accuracy when handling the task of missing link prediction for a given DWDN.",

    "abstract": "Network analysis is an effective approach for examining complex relationships between psychiatric symptoms. This study was designed to examine item-level relationships between depressive and anxiety symptoms using network analysis in an adolescent sample and identified the most central symptoms within the depressive-anxiety symptoms network model. Depressive and anxiety symptoms were assessed using the Patient Health Questionire-9 (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Screener (GAD-7), respectively. The structure of depressive and anxiety symptoms was characterized using \u201cStrength\u201d and \u201cBridge Strength\u201d as centrality indices in the symptom network. Network stability was tested using a case-dropping bootstrap procedure. Finally, a Network Comparison Test (NCT) was conducted to examine whether network characteristics differed on the basis of gender, school grade and residence. Network analysis revealed that nodes PHQ2 (\u201cSad mood\u201d), GAD6 (\u201cIrritability\u201d), GAD3 (\u201cWorry too much\u201d), and PHQ6 (\u201cGuilty\u201d) were central symptoms in the network model of adolescents. Additionally, bridge symptoms linking anxiety and depressive symptoms in this sample were nodes PHQ6 (\u201cGuilty\u201d), PHQ2 (\u201cSad mood\u201d), and PHQ9 (\u201cSuicide ideation\u201d). Gender, school grade and residence did not significantly affect the network structure. Central symptoms (e.g., Sad mood, Irritability, Worry too much, and Guilty) and key bridge symptoms (e.g., Guilty, Sad mood, and Suicide ideation) in the depressive and anxiety symptoms network may be useful as potential targets for intervention among adolescents who are at risk for or suffer from depressive and anxiety symptoms.",

    "title": "A Novel Spatial-Temporal Multi-Scale Alignment Graph Neural Network Security Model for Vehicles Prediction",
    "abstract": "Traffic flow forecasting is indispensable in today\u2019s society and regarded as a key problem for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), as emergency delays in vehicles can cause serious traffic security accidents. However, the complex dynamic spatial-temporal dependency and correlation between different locations on the road make it a challenging task for security in transportation. To date, most existing forecasting frames make use of graph convolution to model the dynamic spatial-temporal correlation of vehicle transportation data, ignoring semantic similarity between nodes and thus, resulting in accuracy degradation. In addition, traffic data does not strictly follow periodicity and hard to be captured. To solve the aforementioned challenging issues, we propose in this article CRFAST-GCN, a multi-branch spatial-temporal attention graph convolution network. First, we capture the multi-scale (e.g., hour, day, and week) long- short-term dependencies through three identical branches, then introduce conditional random field (CRF) enhanced graph convolution network to capture the semantic similarity globally, so then we exploit the attention mechanism to captures the periodicity. For model evaluation using two real-world datasets, performance analysis shows that the proposed CRFAST-GCN successfully handles the complex spatial-temporal dynamics effectively and achieves improvement over the baselines at 50% (maximum), outperforming other advanced existing methods.",

    "abstract": "Predicting protein-ligand binding affinity is a central issue in drug design. Various deep learning models have been developed in recent years to tackle this issue, but many of them merely focus on reproducing the binding affinity of known binders. In this study, we have developed a graph neural network model called PLANET (Protein-Ligand Affinity prediction NETwork). This model takes the graph-represented 3D structure of the binding pocket on the target protein and the 2D chemical structure of the ligand molecule as input, and it was trained through a multi-objective process with three related tasks, including deriving the protein\u2013ligand binding affinity, protein\u2013ligand contact map, and intra-ligand distance matrix. To serve those tasks, a large number of decoy non-binders were selected and added to the standard PDBbind data set. When tested on the CASF-2016 benchmark, PLANET exhibited a scoring power comparable to other deep learning models that rely on 3D protein\u2013ligand complex structures as input. It also showed notably better performance in virtual screening trials on the DUD-E and LIT-PCBA benchmark. In particular, PLANET achieved comparable accuracy on LIT-PCBA as the conventional docking program Glide. However, it only took less than 1% of the computation time required by Glide to finish the same job because it did not perform exhaustive conformational sampling. In summary, PLANET exhibited a decent performance in binding affinity prediction as well as virtual screening, which makes it potentially useful for drug discovery in practice.",

The study finds the following: (1) The overall characteristics of the network show that the connectivity and diversification of China\u2019s REIN is increasing. (2) The network spatial pattern analysis shows that the REIN exhibits a radial spatial pattern centered on Beijing at both the provincial and municipal levels. (3) Research on network nodes shows that the network is dense in eastern regions and sparse in western regions, showing distinct characteristics of coastal and resource agglomeration. Not all regions with high levels of economic development play leading roles in the REIN. Small and medium-sized cities with abundant rare earth resources also play important",

    "abstract": "Global scientific output is expanding exponentially, which in turn calls for a better understanding of the science of science and especially how the boundaries of scientific fields expand through processes of emergence. The present study proposes the application of embedded topic modeling techniques to identify new emerging science via knowledge recombination activities as evidenced through the analysis of research publication metadata. First, a dataset is constructed from metadata derived from the Web of Science Core Collection database. The dataset is then used to generate a global map representing a categorical scientific co-occurrence network. A research field is defined as interdisciplinary when multiple science categories are listed in its description. Second, the co-occurrence networks are subsequently compared between periods to determine changing patterns of influence in light of interdisciplinarity. Third, embedded topic modeling enables unsupervised association of interdisciplinary classification. We present the results of the analysis to demonstrate the emergence of global interdisciplinary sciences and further we perform qualitative validation on the results to identify what the sources of the emergent areas are. Based on these results, we discuss potential applications for identifying emergence through the merging of global interdisciplinary domains.",

    "abstract": "Current technology is producing high throughput biomedical data at an ever-growing rate. A common approach to interpreting such data is through network-based analyses. Since biological networks are notoriously complex and hard to decipher, a growing body of work applies graph embedding techniques to simplify, visualize, and facilitate the analysis of the resulting networks. In this review, we survey traditional and new approaches for graph embedding and compare their application to fundamental problems in network biology with using the networks directly. We consider a broad variety of applications including protein network alignment, community detection, and protein function prediction. We find that in all of these domains both types of approaches are of value and their performance depends on the evaluation measures being used and the goal of the project. In particular, network embedding methods outshine direct methods according to some of those measures and are, thus, an essential tool in bioinformatics research.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) instigating Chikungunya fever is a global infective menace resulting in high fever, weakened joint-muscle pain, and brain inflammation. Inaccessibility and unavailability of effective drugs have led us to an uncertain arena when it comes to providing proper medical treatment to the affected people. In this study, authentic encroachment has been made concerning the peptide-based epitope vaccine designing against CHIKV. A Proteome-wide search was performed to locate a conserved portion among the accessible viral outer membrane proteins which showcase a remarkable immune response using specific immunoinformatics and docking simulation tools. Primarily, the most probable immunogenic envelope glycoproteins E1 and E2 were identified from the UniProt database depending on their antigenicity scores. Subsequently, we selected two distinctive sequences \u201cSEDVYANTQLVLQRP\u201d and \u201cIMLLYPDHPTLLSYR\u201d in both E1 and E2 glycoproteins respectively. These two sequences identified as the most potent T and B cell epitope-based peptides as they interacted with 6 and 7 HLA-I and 5 HLA-II molecules with an extremely low IC50 score that was verified by molecular docking. Moreover, the sequences possess no allergenicity and are certainly located outside the transmembrane region. In addition, the sequences exhibited 88.46% and 100.00% Conservancy, covering high population coverage of 89.49% to 94.74% and 60.51% to 88.87% respectively in endemic countries. The identified peptide SEDVYANTQLVLQRP and IMLLYPDHPTLLSYR can be utilized next for the development of peptide-based epitope vaccine contrary to CHIKV, so further documentations and experimentations like Antigen testing, Antigen production, Clinical trials are needed to prove the validity of it.

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Scientific advances in genetic analysis have been made possible in recent years by technical developments in computational biology, or bioinformatics. Bioinformatics has opened up the human genome to diverse analyses involving automated laboratory hardware and machine learning algorithms and software. As part of an emerging field of social genomics, recent educational genetics studies using big data have begun to raise challenging findings linking DNA to predicted life outcomes. Bioinformatic technologies and techniques including \u2018genome-wide association\u2019 and \u2018polygenic scoring\u2019 are producing new kinds of genetic biodata and expert knowledge for rethinking the upbringing and education of children. This article takes as an empirical opening a recent epistemic and ethical controversy over the use of biodata to make genetic predictions about educational, socio-economic and life outcomes, detailing the forms of expert knowledge and technologies involved these predictions, and exploring the social and ethical implications of data-intensive bioinformatics.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: The receptor-binding domain (RBD) in SARS-CoV-2 binds strongly to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors and causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) is a well-established treatment option for the treatment of several viral infections. This in silico study was conducted to target the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 as a target site for aPDT. Methods: SARS-CoV-2-RBD was selected as a novel target for indocyanine green (ICG) as a photosensitizer during aPDT to exploit its molecular modeling, hierarchical nature of protein structure, and physico-chemical properties using several bioinformatic tools. The binding mode of the RBD to ICG was assessed via protein-ligand docking. Results: The results of a computational biology analysis revealed that SARS-CoV-2-RBD has 223 amino acids with a molecular weight of 25098.40 Da. RBD is most similar to 6W41 with an E-value of 4e-167, identity of 100%, and query cover of 100%. The aliphatic index of the RBD protein sequences was 71.61, suggesting that the protein is stable in a broad spectrum of temperatures. The predicted structure of RBD showed that it is a protein with a positive charge and a random coil structure (69.51%). Four ligands were modeled in this entry, including one N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (NAG), one glycerol (GOL), and two sulfate ions (SO4 ), to which ICG desires to bind in the molecular docking analysis. Conclusion: Molecular modeling and simulation analysis showed that SARS-CoV-2-RBD could be a substrate for binding to ICG during aPDT to control the spread of COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Mean Field Games (MFG) have been introduced to tackle games with a large number of competing players. Considering the limit when the number of players is infinite, Nash equilibria are studied by considering the interaction of a typical player with the population's distribution. The situation in which the players cooperate corresponds to Mean Field Control (MFC) problems, which can also be viewed as optimal control problems driven by a McKean-Vlasov dynamics. These two types of problems have found a wide range of potential applications, for which numerical methods play a key role since most models do not have analytical solutions. In these notes, we review several aspects of numerical methods for MFG and MFC. We start by presenting some heuristics in a basic linear-quadratic setting. We then discuss numerical schemes for forward-backward systems of partial differential equations (PDEs), optimization techniques for variational problems driven by a Kolmogorov-Fokker-Planck PDE, an approach based on a monotone operator viewpoint, and stochastic methods relying on machine learning tools.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The recent biotechnological progress has allowed life scientists and physicians to access an unprecedented, massive amount of data at all levels (molecular, supramolecular, cellular and so on) of biological complexity. So far, mostly classical computational efforts have been dedicated to the simulation, prediction or de novo design of biomolecules, in order to improve the understanding of their function or to develop novel therapeutics. At a higher level of complexity, the progress of omics disciplines (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics) has prompted researchers to develop informatics means to describe and annotate new biomolecules identified with a resolution down to the single cell, but also with a high-throughput speed. Machine learning approaches have been implemented to both the modelling studies and the handling of biomedical data. Quantum computing (QC) approaches hold the promise to resolve, speed up or refine the analysis of a wide range of these computational problems. Here, we review and comment on recently developed QC algorithms for biocomputing, with a particular focus on multi-scale modelling and genomic analyses. Indeed, differently from other computational approaches such as protein structure prediction, these problems have been shown to be adequately mapped onto quantum architectures, the main limit for their immediate use being the number of qubits and decoherence effects in the available quantum machines. Possible advantages over the classical counterparts are highlighted, along with a description of some hybrid classical/quantum approaches, which could be the closest to be realistically applied in biocomputation.",

    "abstract": "Background Effective treatment is needed for advanced, inoperable, or chemotherapy-resistant cervical cancer patients. Immunotherapy has become a new treatment modality for cervical cancer patients, and there is an urgent need to identify additional targets for cervical cancer immunotherapy. Methods In this study the core gene, RGS1, which affects immune status and the FIGO stage of cervical cancer patients was identified by WGCNA analysis and differential analysis using TCGA database. 10 related genes interacting with RGS1 were identified using PPI network, and the functional and immune correlations were analyzed. Based on the expression of RGS1 and related genes, the consensus clustering method was used to divide CESC patients into two groups (group 1, high expression of RGS1; group 2, low expression of RGS1). Then, the functional enrichment analysis was used to search for the functional differences in differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between group 1 and group 2. Immune infiltration analysis was performed using ESTIMATE, CIBERSORT, and ssGSEA, and the differences in expression of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) targets were assessed between the two groups. We investigated the effect of RGS1 on the clinical relevance of CESC patients, and experimentally verified the differences in RGS1 expression between cervical cancer patient tissues and normal cervical tissues, the role of RGS1 in cell function, and the effect on tumor growth in tumor-bearing mice. Results We found that RGS1 was associated with CD4, GNAI3, RGS2, GNAO1, GNAI2, RGS20, GNAZ, GNAI1, HLA-DRA and HLA-DRB1, especially CD4 and RGS2. Functional enrichment of DEGs was associated with T cell activation. Compared with group 2, group 1 had stronger immune infiltration and higher ICI target expression. RGS1 had higher expression in cervical cancer tissues than normal tissues, especially in HPV-E6 positive cancer tissues. In cervical cancer cell lines, knockdown of RGS1 can inhibited cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and tumor growth in nude mice and promoted apoptosis. Conclusions RGS1, as an oncogenic gene of cervical cancer, affects the immune microenvironment of patients with cervical cancer and may be a target of immunotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Objective To identify the genetic mechanisms of immunosuppression-related genes implicated in ischemic stroke. Background A better understanding of immune-related genes (IGs) involved in the pathophysiology of ischemic stroke may help identify drug targets beneficial for immunomodulatory approaches and reducing stroke-induced immunosuppression complications. Methods Two datasets related to ischemic stroke were downloaded from the GEO database. Immunosuppression-associated genes were obtained from three databases (i.e., DisGeNET, HisgAtlas, and Drugbank). The CIBERSORT algorithm was used to calculate the mean proportions of 22 immune-infiltrating cells in the stroke samples. Differential gene expression analysis was performed to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) involved in stroke. Immunosuppression-related crosstalk genes were identified as the overlapping genes between ischemic stroke-DEGs and IGs. Feature selection was performed using the Boruta algorithm and a classifier model was constructed to evaluate the prediction accuracy of the obtained immunosuppression-related crosstalk genes. Functional enrichment analysis, gene-transcriptional factor and gene-drug interaction networks were constructed. Results Twenty two immune cell subsets were identified in stroke, where resting CD4 T memory cells were significantly downregulated while M0 macrophages were significantly upregulated. By overlapping the 54 crosstalk genes obtained by feature selection with ischemic stroke-related genes obtained from the DisGenet database, 17 potentially most valuable immunosuppression-related crosstalk genes were obtained, ARG1, CD36, FCN1, GRN, IL7R, JAK2, MAFB, MMP9, PTEN, STAT3, STAT5A, THBS1, TLR2, TLR4, TLR7, TNFSF10, and VASP. Regulatory transcriptional factors targeting key immunosuppression-related crosstalk genes in stroke included STAT3, SPI1, CEPBD, SP1, TP53, NFIL3, STAT1, HIF1A, and JUN. In addition, signaling pathways enriched by the crosstalk genes, including PD-L1 expression and PD-1 checkpoint pathway, NF-kappa B signaling, IL-17 signaling, TNF signaling, and NOD-like receptor signaling, were also identified. Conclusion Putative crosstalk genes that link immunosuppression and ischemic stroke were identified using bioinformatics analysis and machine learning approaches. These may be regarded as potential therapeutic targets for ischemic stroke.",

    "abstract": "Today's large-scale scientific applications running on high-performance computing (HPC) systems generate vast data volumes. Thus, data compression is becoming a critical technique to mitigate the storage burden and data-movement cost. However, existing lossy compressors for scientific data cannot achieve a high compression ratio and throughput simultaneously, hindering their adoption in many applications requiring fast compression, such as in-memory compression. To this end, in this work, we develop a fast and high- ratio error-bounded lossy compressor on GPUs for scientific data (called FZ-GPU). Specifically, we first design a new compression pipeline that consists of fully parallelized quantization, bitshuffle, and our newly designed fast encoding. Then, we propose a series of deep architectural optimizations for each kernel in the pipeline to take full advantage of CUDA architectures. We propose a warp-level optimization to avoid data conflicts for bit-wise operations in bitshuffle, maximize shared memory utilization, and eliminate unnecessary data movements by fusing different compression kernels. Finally, we evaluate FZ-GPU on two NVIDIA GPUs (i.e., A100 and RTX A4000) using six representative scientific datasets from SDRBench. Results on the A100 GPU show that FZ-GPU achieves an average speedup of 4.2\u00d7 over cuSZ and an average speedup of 37.0\u00d7 over a multi-threaded CPU implementation of our algorithm under the same error bound. FZ-GPU also achieves an average speedup of 2.3\u00d7 and an average compression ratio improvement of 2.0\u00d7 over cuZFP under the same data distortion.",

    "title": "Big-PERCIVAL: Exploring the Native Use of 64-Bit Posit Arithmetic in Scientific Computing",
    "abstract": "The accuracy requirements in many scientific computing workloads result in the use of double-precision floating-point arithmetic in the execution kernels. Nevertheless, emerging real-number representations, such as posit arithmetic, show promise in delivering even higher accuracy in such computations. In this work, we explore the native use of 64-bit posits in a series of numerical benchmarks and compare their timing performance, accuracy and hardware cost to IEEE 754 doubles. In addition, we also study the conjugate gradient method for numerically solving systems of linear equations in real-world applications. For this, we extend the PERCIVAL RISC-V core and the Xposit custom RISC-V extension with posit64 and quire operations. Results show that posit64 can obtain up to 4 orders of magnitude lower mean square error than doubles. This leads to a reduction in the number of iterations required for convergence in some iterative solvers. However, leveraging the quire accumulator register can limit the order of some operations such as matrix multiplications. Furthermore, detailed FPGA and ASIC synthesis results highlight the significant hardware cost of 64-bit posit arithmetic and quire. Despite this, the large accuracy improvements achieved with the same memory bandwidth suggest that posit arithmetic may provide a potential alternative representation for scientific computing.",

    "title": "In Silico Insights into the Arsenic Binding Mechanism Deploying Application of Computational Biology-Based Toolsets",
    "abstract": "An assortment of environmental matrices includes arsenic (As) in its different oxidation states, which is often linked to concerns that pose a threat to public health worldwide. The current difficulty lies in addressing toxicological concerns and achieving sustained detoxification of As. Multiple conventional degradation methods are accessible; however, they are indeed labor-intensive, expensive, and reliant on prolonged laboratory evaluations. Molecular interaction and atomic level degradation mechanisms for enzyme-As exploration are, however, underexplored in those approaches. A feasible approach in this case for tackling this accompanying concern of As might be to cope with undertaking multivalent computational methodologies and tools. This work aimed to provide molecular-level insight into the enzyme-aided As degradation mechanism. AutoDock Vina, CABS-flex 2.0, and Desmond high-performance molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) were utilized in the current investigation to simulate multivalent molecular processes on two protein sets: arsenate reductase (ArsC) and laccase (LAC) corresponding arsenate (ART) and arsenite (AST), which served as model ligands to comprehend binding, conformational, and energy attributes. The structural configurations of both proteins exhibited variability in flexibility and structure framework within the range of 3.5\u20134.5 \u00c5. The LAC-ART complex exhibited the lowest calculated binding affinity, measuring \u22125.82 \u00b1 0.01 kcal/mol. Meanwhile, active site residues ILE-200 and HIS-206 were demonstrated to engage in H-bonding with the ART ligand. In contrast to ArsC, the ligand binding affinity of this bound complex was considerably greater. Additional validation of docked complexes was carried out by deploying Desmond MDS of 100 ns to capture protein and ligand conformation behavior. The system achieved stability during the 100 ns simulation run, as confirmed by the average P-L RMSD, which was \u223c1 \u00c5. As a preliminary test of the enzyme\u2019s ability to catalyze As species, corresponding computational insights might be advantageous for bridging gaps and regulatory consideration.",

    "abstract": "Background Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is a degenerative brain disease without a cure. Lonicerae Japonicae Flos (LJF), a traditional Chinese herbal medicine, possesses a neuroprotective effect, but its mechanisms for AD are not well understood. This study aimed to investigate potential targets and constituents of LJF against AD. Methods Network pharmacology and bioinformatics analyses were performed to screen potential compounds and targets. Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets related to AD patients were used to screen core targets of differential expression. Gene expression profiling interactive analysis (GEPIA) was used to validate the correlation between core target genes and major causative genes of AD. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to evaluate the predictive efficacy of core targets based on GEO datasets. Molecular docking and dynamics simulation were conducted to analyze the binding affinities of effective compounds with core targets. Results Network pharmacology analysis showed that 112 intersection targets were identified. Bioinformatics analysis displayed that 32 putative core targets were identified from 112 intersection targets. Only eight core targets were differentially expressed based on GEO datasets. Finally, six core targets of MAPK8, CTNNB1, NFKB1, EGFR, BCL2, and NFE2L2 were related to AD progression and had good predictive ability based on correlation and ROC analyses. Molecular docking and dynamics simulation analyses elucidated that the component of lignan interacted with EGFR, the component of \u03b2-carotene interacted with CTNNB1 and BCL2, the component of \u03b2-sitosterol interacted with BCL2, the component of hederagenin interacted with NFKB1, the component of berberine interacted with EGFR and BCL2, and the component of baicalein interacted with NFKB1, EGFR and BCL2. Conclusion Through a comprehensive analysis, this study revealed that six core targets (MAPK8, CTNNB1, NFKB1, EGFR, BCL2, and NFE2L2) and six practical components (lignan, \u03b2-carotene, \u03b2-sitosterol, hederagenin, berberine, and baicalein) were involved in the mechanism of action of LJF against AD. Our work demonstrated that LJF effectively treats AD through its multi-component and multi-target properties. The findings of this study will establish a theoretical basis for the expanded application of LJF in AD treatment and, hopefully, can guide more advanced experimental research in the future.",

    "title": "Design of multi-epitope vaccine against porcine rotavirus using computational biology and molecular dynamics simulation approaches",
    "abstract": "Porcine Rotavirus (PoRV) is a significant pathogen affecting swine-rearing regions globally, presenting a substantial threat to the economic development of the livestock sector. At present, no specific pharmaceuticals are available for this disease, and treatment options remain exceedingly limited. This study seeks to design a multi-epitope peptide vaccine for PoRV employing bioinformatics approaches to robustly activate T-cell and B-cell immune responses. Two antigenic proteins, VP7 and VP8*, were selected from PoRV, and potential immunogenic T-cell and B-cell epitopes were predicted using immunoinformatic tools. These epitopes were further screened according to non-toxicity, antigenicity, non-allergenicity, and immunogenicity criteria. The selected epitopes were linked with linkers to form a novel multi-epitope vaccine construct, with the PADRE sequence (AKFVAAWTLKAAA) and RS09 peptide attached at the N-terminus of the designed peptide chain to enhance the vaccine\u2019s antigenicity. Protein-protein docking of the vaccine constructs with toll-like receptors (TLR3 and TLR4) was conducted using computational methods, with the lowest energy docking results selected as the optimal predictive model. Subsequently, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation methods were employed to assess the stability of the protein vaccine constructs and TLR3 and TLR4 receptors. The results indicated that the vaccine-TLR3 and vaccine-TLR4 docking models remained stable throughout the simulation period. Additionally, the C-IMMSIM tool was utilized to determine the immunogenic triggering capability of the vaccine protein, demonstrating that the constructed vaccine protein could induce both cell-mediated and humoral immune responses, thereby playing a role in eliciting host immune responses. In conclusion, this study successfully constructed a multi-epitope vaccine against PoRV and validated the stability and efficacy of the vaccine through computational analysis. However, as the study is purely computational, experimental evaluation is required to validate the safety and immunogenicity of the newly constructed vaccine protein.",

    "title": "Network pharmacology, computational biology integrated surface plasmon resonance technology reveals the mechanism of ellagic acid against rotavirus",
    "abstract": "The target and mechanism of ellagic acid (EA) against rotavirus (RV) were investigated by network pharmacology, computational biology, and surface plasmon resonance verification. The target of EA was obtained from 11 databases such as HIT and TCMSP, and RV-related targets were obtained from the Gene Cards database. The relevant targets were imported into the Venny platform to draw a Venn diagram, and their intersections were visualized. The protein\u2013protein interaction networks (PPI) were constructed using STRING, DAVID database, and Cytoscape software, and key targets were screened. The target was enriched by Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway, and the \u2018EA anti-RV target-pathway network\u2019 was constructed. Schrodinger Maestro 13.5 software was used for molecular docking to determine the binding free energy and binding mode of ellagic acid and target protein. The Desmond program was used for molecular dynamics simulation. Saturation mutagenesis analysis was performed using Schrodinger's Maestro 13.5 software. Finally, the affinity between ellagic acid and TLR4 protein was investigated by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments. The results of network pharmacological analysis showed that there were 35 intersection proteins, among which Interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), Albumin (ALB), Nuclear factor kappa-B1 (NF-\u03baB1), Toll-Like Receptor 4 (TLR4), Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), Tumor protein p53 (TP53), Recombinant SMAD family member 3 (SAMD3), Epidermal growth factor (EGF) and Interleukin-4 (IL-4) were potential core targets of EA anti-RV. The GO analysis consists of biological processes (BP), cellular components (CC), and molecular functions (MF). The KEGG pathways with the highest gene count were mainly related to enteritis, cancer, IL-17 signaling pathway, and MAPK signaling pathway. Based on the crystal structure of key targets, the complex structure models of TP53-EA, TLR4-EA, TNF-EA, IL-1\u03b2-EA, ALB-EA, NF-\u03baB1-EA, SAMD3-EA, EGF-EA, and IL-4-EA were constructed by molecular docking (XP mode of flexible docking). The MMGBS analysis and molecular dynamics simulation were also studied. The \u0394affinity of TP53 was highest in 220 (CYS\u2009\u2192\u2009TRP), 220 (CYS\u2009\u2192\u2009TYR), and 220 (CYS\u2009\u2192\u2009PHE), respectively. The \u0394affinity of TLR4 was highest in 136 (THR\u2009\u2192\u2009TYR), 136 (THR\u2009\u2192\u2009PHE), and 136 (THR\u2009\u2192\u2009TRP). The \u0394affinity of TNF-\u03b1 was highest in 150 (VAL\u2009\u2192\u2009TRP), 18 (ALA\u2009\u2192\u2009GLU), and 144 (PHE\u2009\u2192\u2009GLY). SPR results showed that ellagic acid could bind TLR4 protein specifically. TP53, TLR4, and TNF-\u03b1 are potential targets for EA to exert anti-RV effects, which may ultimately provide theoretical basis and clues for EA to be used as anti-RV drugs by regulating TLR4/NF-\u03baB related pathways.",

In this paper, we detail the principles that drove the implementation of PyTorch and how they are reflected in its architecture. We emphasize that every aspect of PyTorch is a regular Python program under the full control of its user. We also explain how the careful and pragmatic implementation of the key components of its runtime enables them to work together to achieve compelling performance. We demonstrate the efficiency of individual subsystems, as well as the overall speed of PyTorch on several commonly used benchmarks.",

    "abstract": "Deep convolutional neural networks have performed remarkably well on many Computer Vision tasks. However, these networks are heavily reliant on big data to avoid overfitting. Overfitting refers to the phenomenon when a network learns a function with very high variance such as to perfectly model the training data. Unfortunately, many application domains do not have access to big data, such as medical image analysis. This survey focuses on Data Augmentation, a data-space solution to the problem of limited data. Data Augmentation encompasses a suite of techniques that enhance the size and quality of training datasets such that better Deep Learning models can be built using them. The image augmentation algorithms discussed in this survey include geometric transformations, color space augmentations, kernel filters, mixing images, random erasing, feature space augmentation, adversarial training, generative adversarial networks, neural style transfer, and meta-learning. The application of augmentation methods based on GANs are heavily covered in this survey. In addition to augmentation techniques, this paper will briefly discuss other characteristics of Data Augmentation such as test-time augmentation, resolution impact, final dataset size, and curriculum learning. This survey will present existing methods for Data Augmentation, promising developments, and meta-level decisions for implementing Data Augmentation. Readers will understand how Data Augmentation can improve the performance of their models and expand limited datasets to take advantage of the capabilities of big data.",

Most existing methods recover high-resolution representations from low-resolution representations produced by a high-to-low resolution network. Instead, our proposed network maintains high-resolution representations through the whole process. We start from a high-resolution subnetwork as the first stage, gradually add high-to-low resolution subnetworks one by one to form more stages, and connect the mutli-resolution subnetworks in parallel. We conduct repeated multi-scale fusions such that each of the high-to-low resolution representations receives information from other parallel representations over and over, leading to rich high-resolution representations. As a result, the predicted keypoint heatmap is potentially more accurate and spatially more precise. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our network through the superior pose estimation results over two benchmark datasets: the COCO keypoint detection dataset and the MPII Human Pose dataset. In addition, we show the superiority of our network in pose tracking on the PoseTrack dataset.

    "title": "Low-Rank Quaternion Approximation for Color Image Processing",
    "abstract": "Low-rank matrix approximation (LRMA)-based methods have made a great success for grayscale image processing. When handling color images, LRMA either restores each color channel independently using the monochromatic model or processes the concatenation of three color channels using the concatenation model. However, these two schemes may not make full use of the high correlation among RGB channels. To address this issue, we propose a novel low-rank quaternion approximation (LRQA) model. It contains two major components: first, instead of modeling a color image pixel as a scalar in conventional sparse representation and LRMA-based methods, the color image is encoded as a pure quaternion matrix, such that the cross-channel correlation of color channels can be well exploited; second, LRQA imposes the low-rank constraint on the constructed quaternion matrix. To better estimate the singular values of the underlying low-rank quaternion matrix from its noisy observation, a general model for LRQA is proposed based on several nonconvex functions. Extensive evaluations for color image denoising and inpainting tasks verify that LRQA achieves better performance over several state-of-the-art sparse representation and LRMA-based methods in terms of both quantitative metrics and visual quality.",

    "title": "Model Watermarking for Image Processing Networks",
    "abstract": "Deep learning has achieved tremendous success in numerous industrial applications. As training a good model often needs massive high-quality data and computation resources, the learned models often have significant business values. However, these valuable deep models are exposed to a huge risk of infringements. For example, if the attacker has the full information of one target model including the network structure and weights, the model can be easily finetuned on new datasets. Even if the attacker can only access the output of the target model, he/she can still train another similar surrogate model by generating a large scale of input-output training pairs. How to protect the intellectual property of deep models is a very important but seriously under-researched problem. There are a few recent attempts at classification network protection only.In this paper, we propose the first model watermarking framework for protecting image processing models. To achieve this goal, we leverage the spatial invisible watermarking mechanism. Specifically, given a black-box target model, a unified and invisible watermark is hidden into its outputs, which can be regarded as a special task-agnostic barrier. In this way, when the attacker trains one surrogate model by using the input-output pairs of the target model, the hidden watermark will be learned and extracted afterward. To enable watermarks from binary bits to high-resolution images, both traditional and deep spatial invisible watermarking mechanism are considered. Experiments demonstrate the robustness of the proposed watermarking mechanism, which can resist surrogate models learned with different network structures and objective functions. Besides deep models, the proposed method is also easy to be extended to protect data and traditional image processing algorithms.",

    "title": "A survey on deep learning tools dealing with data scarcity: definitions, challenges, solutions, tips, and applications",
    "abstract": "Data scarcity is a major challenge when training deep learning (DL) models. DL demands a large amount of data to achieve exceptional performance. Unfortunately, many applications have small or inadequate data to train DL frameworks. Usually, manual labeling is needed to provide labeled data, which typically involves human annotators with a vast background of knowledge. This annotation process is costly, time-consuming, and error-prone. Usually, every DL framework is fed by a significant amount of labeled data to automatically learn representations. Ultimately, a larger amount of data would generate a better DL model and its performance is also application dependent. This issue is the main barrier for many applications dismissing the use of DL. Having sufficient data is the first step toward any successful and trustworthy DL application. This paper presents a holistic survey on state-of-the-art techniques to deal with training DL models to overcome three challenges including small, imbalanced datasets, and lack of generalization. This survey starts by listing the learning techniques. Next, the types of DL architectures are introduced. After that, state-of-the-art solutions to address the issue of lack of training data are listed, such as Transfer Learning (TL), Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Model Architecture (MA), Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN), and Deep Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (DeepSMOTE). Then, these solutions were followed by some related tips about data acquisition needed prior to training purposes, as well as recommendations for ensuring the trustworthiness of the training dataset. The survey ends with a list of applications that suffer from data scarcity, several alternatives are proposed in order to generate more data in each application including Electromagnetic Imaging (EMI), Civil Structural Health Monitoring, Medical imaging, Meteorology, Wireless Communications, Fluid Mechanics, Microelectromechanical system, and Cybersecurity. To the best of the authors\u2019 knowledge, this is the first review that offers a comprehensive overview on strategies to tackle data scarcity in DL.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning (DL) is revolutionizing evidence-based decision-making techniques that can be applied across various sectors. Specifically, it possesses the ability to utilize two or more levels of non-linear feature transformation of the given data via representation learning in order to overcome limitations posed by large datasets. As a multidisciplinary field that is still in its nascent phase, articles that survey DL architectures encompassing the full scope of the field are rather limited. Thus, this paper comprehensively reviews the state-of-art DL modelling techniques and provides insights into their advantages and challenges. It was found that many of the models exhibit a highly domain-specific efficiency and could be trained by two or more methods. However, training DL models can be very time-consuming, expensive, and requires huge samples for better accuracy. Since DL is also susceptible to deception and misclassification and tends to get stuck on local minima, improved optimization of parameters is required to create more robust models. Regardless, DL has already been leading to groundbreaking results in the healthcare, education, security, commercial, industrial, as well as government sectors. Some models, like the convolutional neural network (CNN), generative adversarial networks (GAN), recurrent neural network (RNN), recursive neural networks, and autoencoders, are frequently used, while the potential of other models remains widely unexplored. Pertinently, hybrid conventional DL architectures have the capacity to overcome the challenges experienced by conventional models. Considering that capsule architectures may dominate future DL models, this work aimed to compile information for stakeholders involved in the development and use of DL models in the contemporary world.",

The performance of the proposed algorithm is tested on two sets of images, one of which contains fire; the other contains fire-like regions. Standard methods are used for calculating the performance of the algorithm. The proposed method has both higher detection rate and lower false alarm rate.

    "abstract": "Skin cancer, particularly malignant melanoma, poses a significant health threat, underscoring the critical need for accurate and timely detection. This project focuses on developing a skin cancer detection system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), specifically tailored to differentiate between benign and malignant melanomas. The utilization of artificial intelligence in medical image analysis aims to enhance early diagnosis, reduce manual examination reliance, and contribute to improved patient outcomes. By focusing on the differentiationbetween benign and malignant melanomas, theproject aimsto contributetopersonalized treatment plans, early intervention strategies, and improved prognostic outcomes for patients. Skin cancer is one of the most prevalent types of cancer worldwide, with early detection being crucial for effective treatment. we propose a comprehensive approach for the automated detection of skin cancer lesions leveraging image processing techniques and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classification. The proposed methodology comprises several stages. Firstly, preprocessing techniques are applied to enhance the quality of input images into RBG. Subsequently,Gray LevelCooccurrence Matrix (GLCM) features are extracted from the preprocessed images and converted into binary representations to capture texture information effectively. These binary GLCM features are then fed into a CNN-based classification algorithm. The CNN model is trained on a large dataset of annotated skin lesion images, allowing it to learn discriminative features indicative of malignant or benign characteristics. The trained CNN model is capable of classifying unseen skin lesion images accurately. The proposed approach offers several advantages, including automation, which reduces the dependence on manual inspection by dermatologists, thereby potentially increasing the efficiency and accuracy of skin cancer diagnosis. Moreover, by integrating both preprocessing techniques and advanced classification algorithms, the proposed system demonstrates robustness and effectiveness in detecting skin cancer lesions across diverse datasets. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach, achieving high accuracy rates in distinguishingbetween malignantandbenign skinlesions. The proposed methodologyholdspromise for aidinghealthcare professionals in early skin cancer detection, ultimately improving patient outcomes and reducing the burden on healthcare systems.",

    "abstract": "As Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) tools rise in popularity, it becomes increasingly vital to recognize the role they play in shaping societal biases and stereotypes. Although NLP models have shown success in modeling various applications, they propagate and may even amplify gender bias found in text corpora. While the study of bias in artificial intelligence is not new, methods to mitigate gender bias in NLP are relatively nascent. In this paper, we review contemporary studies on recognizing and mitigating gender bias in NLP. We discuss gender bias based on four forms of representation bias and analyze methods recognizing gender bias. Furthermore, we discuss the advantages and drawbacks of existing gender debiasing methods. Finally, we discuss future studies for recognizing and mitigating gender bias in NLP.",

However, because of the fast-paced advances in this domain, a systematic overview of attention is still missing. In this article, we define a unified model for attention architectures in natural language processing, with a focus on those designed to work with vector representations of the textual data.

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nThis article methodically reviews the literature on deep learning (DL) for natural language processing (NLP) in the clinical domain, providing quantitative analysis to answer 3 research questions concerning methods, scope, and context of current research.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nWe searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, the Association for Computing Machinery Digital Library, and the Association for Computational Linguistics Anthology for articles using DL-based approaches to NLP problems in electronic health records. After screening 1,737 articles, we collected data on 25 variables across 212 papers.\n\n\nRESULTS\nDL in clinical NLP publications more than doubled each year, through 2018. Recurrent neural networks (60.8%) and word2vec embeddings (74.1%) were the most popular methods; the information extraction tasks of text classification, named entity recognition, and relation extraction were dominant (89.2%). However, there was a \"long tail\" of other methods and specific tasks. Most contributions were methodological variants or applications, but 20.8% were new methods of some kind. The earliest adopters were in the NLP community, but the medical informatics community was the most prolific.\n\n\nDISCUSSION\nOur analysis shows growing acceptance of deep learning as a baseline for NLP research, and of DL-based NLP in the medical community. A number of common associations were substantiated (eg, the preference of recurrent neural networks for sequence-labeling named entity recognition), while others were surprisingly nuanced (eg, the scarcity of French language clinical NLP with deep learning).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nDeep learning has not yet fully penetrated clinical NLP and is growing rapidly. This review highlighted both the popular and unique trends in this active field.",

    "title": "Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing in Mental Health: Systematic Review",
    "abstract": "Background Machine learning systems are part of the field of artificial intelligence that automatically learn models from data to make better decisions. Natural language processing (NLP), by using corpora and learning approaches, provides good performance in statistical tasks, such as text classification or sentiment mining. Objective The primary aim of this systematic review was to summarize and characterize, in methodological and technical terms, studies that used machine learning and NLP techniques for mental health. The secondary aim was to consider the potential use of these methods in mental health clinical practice Methods This systematic review follows the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis) guidelines and is registered with PROSPERO (Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews; number CRD42019107376). The search was conducted using 4 medical databases (PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and PsycINFO) with the following keywords: machine learning, data mining, psychiatry, mental health, and mental disorder. The exclusion criteria were as follows: languages other than English, anonymization process, case studies, conference papers, and reviews. No limitations on publication dates were imposed. Results A total of 327 articles were identified, of which 269 (82.3%) were excluded and 58 (17.7%) were included in the review. The results were organized through a qualitative perspective. Although studies had heterogeneous topics and methods, some themes emerged. Population studies could be grouped into 3 categories: patients included in medical databases, patients who came to the emergency room, and social media users. The main objectives were to extract symptoms, classify severity of illness, compare therapy effectiveness, provide psychopathological clues, and challenge the current nosography. Medical records and social media were the 2 major data sources. With regard to the methods used, preprocessing used the standard methods of NLP and unique identifier extraction dedicated to medical texts. Efficient classifiers were preferred rather than transparent functioning classifiers. Python was the most frequently used platform. Conclusions Machine learning and NLP models have been highly topical issues in medicine in recent years and may be considered a new paradigm in medical research. However, these processes tend to confirm clinical hypotheses rather than developing entirely new information, and only one major category of the population (ie, social media users) is an imprecise cohort. Moreover, some language-specific features can improve the performance of NLP methods, and their extension to other languages should be more closely investigated. However, machine learning and NLP techniques provide useful information from unexplored data (ie, patients\u2019 daily habits that are usually inaccessible to care providers). Before considering It as an additional tool of mental health care, ethical issues remain and should be discussed in a timely manner. Machine learning and NLP methods may offer multiple perspectives in mental health research but should also be considered as tools to support clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Large pre-trained language models have been shown to store factual knowledge in their parameters, and achieve state-of-the-art results when fine-tuned on downstream NLP tasks. However, their ability to access and precisely manipulate knowledge is still limited, and hence on knowledge-intensive tasks, their performance lags behind task-specific architectures. Additionally, providing provenance for their decisions and updating their world knowledge remain open research problems. Pre-trained models with a differentiable access mechanism to explicit non-parametric memory can overcome this issue, but have so far been only investigated for extractive downstream tasks. We explore a general-purpose fine-tuning recipe for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) -- models which combine pre-trained parametric and non-parametric memory for language generation. We introduce RAG models where the parametric memory is a pre-trained seq2seq model and the non-parametric memory is a dense vector index of Wikipedia, accessed with a pre-trained neural retriever. We compare two RAG formulations, one which conditions on the same retrieved passages across the whole generated sequence, the other can use different passages per token. We fine-tune and evaluate our models on a wide range of knowledge-intensive NLP tasks and set the state-of-the-art on three open domain QA tasks, outperforming parametric seq2seq models and task-specific retrieve-and-extract architectures. For language generation tasks, we find that RAG models generate more specific, diverse and factual language than a state-of-the-art parametric-only seq2seq baseline.",

    "abstract": "We survey 146 papers analyzing \u201cbias\u201d in NLP systems, finding that their motivations are often vague, inconsistent, and lacking in normative reasoning, despite the fact that analyzing \u201cbias\u201d is an inherently normative process. We further find that these papers\u2019 proposed quantitative techniques for measuring or mitigating \u201cbias\u201d are poorly matched to their motivations and do not engage with the relevant literature outside of NLP. Based on these findings, we describe the beginnings of a path forward by proposing three recommendations that should guide work analyzing \u201cbias\u201d in NLP systems. These recommendations rest on a greater recognition of the relationships between language and social hierarchies, encouraging researchers and practitioners to articulate their conceptualizations of \u201cbias\u201d---i.e., what kinds of system behaviors are harmful, in what ways, to whom, and why, as well as the normative reasoning underlying these statements\u2014and to center work around the lived experiences of members of communities affected by NLP systems, while interrogating and reimagining the power relations between technologists and such communities.",

Inspired by principles of behavioral testing in software engineering, we introduce CheckList, a task-agnostic methodology for testing NLP models. CheckList includes a matrix of general linguistic capabilities and test types that facilitate comprehensive test ideation, as well as a software tool to generate a large and diverse number of test cases quickly. We illustrate the utility of CheckList with tests for three tasks, identifying critical failures in both commercial and state-of-art models. In a user study, a team responsible for a commercial sentiment analysis model found new and actionable bugs in an extensively tested model. In another user study, NLP practitioners with CheckList created twice as many tests, and found almost three times as many bugs as users without it.",

TextAttack\u2019s modular design enables researchers to easily construct attacks from combinations of novel and existing components. TextAttack provides implementations of 16 adversarial attacks from the literature and supports a variety of models and datasets, including BERT and other transformers, and all GLUE tasks. TextAttack also includes data augmentation and adversarial training modules for using components of adversarial attacks to improve model accuracy and robustness.TextAttack is democratizing NLP: anyone can try data augmentation and adversarial training on any model or dataset, with just a few lines of code.

    "abstract": "The problem of designing NLP solvers for math word problems (MWP) has seen sustained research activity and steady gains in the test accuracy. Since existing solvers achieve high performance on the benchmark datasets for elementary level MWPs containing one-unknown arithmetic word problems, such problems are often considered \u201csolved\u201d with the bulk of research attention moving to more complex MWPs. In this paper, we restrict our attention to English MWPs taught in grades four and lower. We provide strong evidence that the existing MWP solvers rely on shallow heuristics to achieve high performance on the benchmark datasets. To this end, we show that MWP solvers that do not have access to the question asked in the MWP can still solve a large fraction of MWPs. Similarly, models that treat MWPs as bag-of-words can also achieve surprisingly high accuracy. Further, we introduce a challenge dataset, SVAMP, created by applying carefully chosen variations over examples sampled from existing datasets. The best accuracy achieved by state-of-the-art models is substantially lower on SVAMP, thus showing that much remains to be done even for the simplest of the MWPs.",

In this paper, we present a comprehensive and unifying survey of data augmentation for NLP by summarizing the literature in a structured manner. We first introduce and motivate data augmentation for NLP, and then discuss major methodologically representative approaches. Next, we highlight techniques that are used for popular NLP applications and tasks. We conclude by outlining current challenges and directions for future research.

In this paper, we argue that Dynabench addresses a critical need in our community: contemporary models quickly achieve outstanding performance on benchmark tasks but nonetheless fail on simple challenge examples and falter in real-world scenarios. With Dynabench, dataset creation, model development, and model assessment can directly inform each other, leading to more robust and informative benchmarks. We report on four initial NLP tasks, illustrating these concepts and highlighting the promise of the platform, and address potential objections to dynamic benchmarking as a new standard for the field.",

    "title": "Self-Diagnosis and Self-Debiasing: A Proposal for Reducing Corpus-Based Bias in NLP",
    "abstract": "Abstract \u26a0 This paper contains prompts and model outputs that are offensive in nature. When trained on large, unfiltered crawls from the Internet, language models pick up and reproduce all kinds of undesirable biases that can be found in the data: They often generate racist, sexist, violent, or otherwise toxic language. As large models require millions of training examples to achieve good performance, it is difficult to completely prevent them from being exposed to such content. In this paper, we first demonstrate a surprising finding: Pretrained language models recognize, to a considerable degree, their undesirable biases and the toxicity of the content they produce. We refer to this capability as self-diagnosis. Based on this finding, we then propose a decoding algorithm that, given only a textual description of the undesired behavior, reduces the probability of a language model producing problematic text. We refer to this approach as self-debiasing. Self-debiasing does not rely on manually curated word lists, nor does it require any training data or changes to the model\u2019s parameters. While we by no means eliminate the issue of language models generating biased text, we believe our approach to be an important step in this direction.1",

    "title": "Flamingo: a Visual Language Model for Few-Shot Learning",
    "abstract": "Building models that can be rapidly adapted to novel tasks using only a handful of annotated examples is an open challenge for multimodal machine learning research. We introduce Flamingo, a family of Visual Language Models (VLM) with this ability. We propose key architectural innovations to: (i) bridge powerful pretrained vision-only and language-only models, (ii) handle sequences of arbitrarily interleaved visual and textual data, and (iii) seamlessly ingest images or videos as inputs. Thanks to their flexibility, Flamingo models can be trained on large-scale multimodal web corpora containing arbitrarily interleaved text and images, which is key to endow them with in-context few-shot learning capabilities. We perform a thorough evaluation of our models, exploring and measuring their ability to rapidly adapt to a variety of image and video tasks. These include open-ended tasks such as visual question-answering, where the model is prompted with a question which it has to answer; captioning tasks, which evaluate the ability to describe a scene or an event; and close-ended tasks such as multiple-choice visual question-answering. For tasks lying anywhere on this spectrum, a single Flamingo model can achieve a new state of the art with few-shot learning, simply by prompting the model with task-specific examples. On numerous benchmarks, Flamingo outperforms models fine-tuned on thousands of times more task-specific data.",

    "title": "Evolutionary-scale prediction of atomic level protein structure with a language model",
    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence has the potential to open insight into the structure of proteins at the scale of evolution. It has only recently been possible to extend protein structure prediction to two hundred million cataloged proteins. Characterizing the structures of the exponentially growing billions of protein sequences revealed by large scale gene sequencing experiments would necessitate a break-through in the speed of folding. Here we show that direct inference of structure from primary sequence using a large language model enables an order of magnitude speed-up in high resolution structure prediction. Leveraging the insight that language models learn evolutionary patterns across millions of sequences, we train models up to 15B parameters, the largest language model of proteins to date. As the language models are scaled they learn information that enables prediction of the three-dimensional structure of a protein at the resolution of individual atoms. This results in prediction that is up to 60x faster than state-of-the-art while maintaining resolution and accuracy. Building on this, we present the ESM Metage-nomic Atlas. This is the first large-scale structural characterization of metagenomic proteins, with more than 617 million structures. The atlas reveals more than 225 million high confidence predictions, including millions whose structures are novel in comparison with experimentally determined structures, giving an unprecedented view into the vast breadth and diversity of the structures of some of the least understood proteins on earth.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to be able to perform new tasks based on a few demonstrations or natural language instructions. While these capabilities have led to widespread adoption, most LLMs are developed by resource-rich organizations and are frequently kept from the public. As a step towards democratizing this powerful technology, we present BLOOM, a 176B-parameter open-access language model designed and built thanks to a collaboration of hundreds of researchers. BLOOM is a decoder-only Transformer language model that was trained on the ROOTS corpus, a dataset comprising hundreds of sources in 46 natural and 13 programming languages (59 in total). We find that BLOOM achieves competitive performance on a wide variety of benchmarks, with stronger results after undergoing multitask prompted finetuning. To facilitate future research and applications using LLMs, we publicly release our models and code under the Responsible AI License.",

    "abstract": "Program synthesis strives to generate a computer program as a solution to a given problem specification, expressed with input-output examples or natural language descriptions. The prevalence of large language models advances the state-of-the-art for program synthesis, though limited training resources and data impede open access to such models. To democratize this, we train and release a family of large language models up to 16.1B parameters, called CODEGEN, on natural language and programming language data, and open source the training library JAXFORMER. We show the utility of the trained model by demonstrating that it is competitive with the previous state-of-the-art on zero-shot Python code generation on HumanEval. We further investigate the multi-step paradigm for program synthesis, where a single program is factorized into multiple prompts specifying subproblems. To this end, we construct an open benchmark, Multi-Turn Programming Benchmark (MTPB), consisting of 115 diverse problem sets that are factorized into multi-turn prompts. Our analysis on MTPB shows that the same intent provided to CODEGEN in multi-turn fashion significantly improves program synthesis over that provided as a single turn. We make the training library JAXFORMER and model checkpoints available as open source contribution: https://github.com/salesforce/CodeGen.",

    "title": "Code as Policies: Language Model Programs for Embodied Control",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) trained on code-completion have been shown to be capable of synthesizing simple Python programs from docstrings [1]. We find that these code-writing LLMs can be re-purposed to write robot policy code, given natural language commands. Specifically, policy code can express functions or feedback loops that process perception outputs (e.g., from object detectors [2], [3]) and parameterize control primitive APIs. When provided as input several example language commands (formatted as comments) followed by corresponding policy code (via few-shot prompting), LLMs can take in new commands and autonomously re-compose API calls to generate new policy code respectively. By chaining classic logic structures and referencing third-party libraries (e.g., NumPy, Shapely) to perform arithmetic, LLMs used in this way can write robot policies that (i) exhibit spatial-geometric reasoning, (ii) generalize to new instructions, and (iii) prescribe precise values (e.g., velocities) to ambiguous descriptions (\u2018faster\u2019) depending on context (i.e., behavioral commonsense). This paper presents Code as Policies: a robot-centric formulation of language model generated programs (LMPs) that can represent reactive policies (e.g., impedance controllers), as well as waypoint-based policies (vision-based pick and place, trajectory-based control), demonstrated across multiple real robot platforms. Central to our approach is prompting hierarchical code-gen (recursively defining undefined functions), which can write more complex code and also improves state-of-the-art to solve 39.8% of problems on the HumanEval [1] benchmark.

    "abstract": "In this position paper, we argue that the classical evaluation on Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks using annotated benchmarks is in trouble. The worst kind of data contamination happens when a Large Language Model (LLM) is trained on the test split of a benchmark, and then evaluated in the same benchmark. The extent of the problem is unknown, as it is not straightforward to measure. Contamination causes an overestimation of the performance of a contaminated model in a target benchmark and associated task with respect to their non-contaminated counterparts. The consequences can be very harmful, with wrong scientific conclusions being published while other correct ones are discarded. This position paper defines different levels of data contamination and argues for a community effort, including the development of automatic and semi-automatic measures to detect when data from a benchmark was exposed to a model, and suggestions for flagging papers with conclusions that are compromised by data contamination.",

In this survey, we review the open-access and real-world applications of transformers in NLP, specifically focusing on those where text is the primary modality. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art in the use of transformers in NLP, highlight their strengths and limitations, and identify future directions for research. In this way, we aim to provide valuable insights for both researchers and practitioners in the field of NLP. In addition, we provide a detailed analysis of the various challenges faced in the implementation of transformers in real-world applications, including computational efficiency, interpretability, and ethical considerations. Moreover, we highlight the impact of transformers on the NLP community, including their influence on research and the development of new NLP models.",

    "abstract": "In the past few years, it has become increasingly evident that deep neural networks are not resilient enough to withstand adversarial perturbations in input data, leaving them vulnerable to attack. Various authors have proposed strong adversarial attacks for computer vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. As a response, many defense mechanisms have also been proposed to prevent these networks from failing. The significance of defending neural networks against adversarial attacks lies in ensuring that the model\u2019s predictions remain unchanged even if the input data is perturbed. Several methods for adversarial defense in NLP have been proposed, catering to different NLP tasks such as text classification, named entity recognition, and natural language inference. Some of these methods not only defend neural networks against adversarial attacks but also act as a regularization mechanism during training, saving the model from overfitting. This survey aims to review the various methods proposed for adversarial defenses in NLP over the past few years by introducing a novel taxonomy. The survey also highlights the fragility of advanced deep neural networks in NLP and the challenges involved in defending them.",

The advancement in the NLP area has helped solve problems in the domains such as Neural Machine Translation, Name Entity Recognition, Sentiment Analysis, and Chatbots, to name a few. The topic of NLP broadly consists of two main parts: the representation of the input text (raw data) into numerical format (vectors or matrix) and the design of models for processing the numerical data. This paper focuses on the former part and surveys how the NLP field has evolved from rule-based, statistical to more context-sensitive learned representations. For each embedding type, we list their representation, issues they addressed, limitations, and applications. This survey covers the history of text representations from the 1970s and onwards, from regular expressions to the latest vector representations used to encode the raw text data. It demonstrates how the NLP field progressed from where it could comprehend just bits and pieces to all the significant aspects of the text over time.",

    "abstract": "We present the Qwen2-VL Series, an advanced upgrade of the previous Qwen-VL models that redefines the conventional predetermined-resolution approach in visual processing. Qwen2-VL introduces the Naive Dynamic Resolution mechanism, which enables the model to dynamically process images of varying resolutions into different numbers of visual tokens. This approach allows the model to generate more efficient and accurate visual representations, closely aligning with human perceptual processes. The model also integrates Multimodal Rotary Position Embedding (M-RoPE), facilitating the effective fusion of positional information across text, images, and videos. We employ a unified paradigm for processing both images and videos, enhancing the model's visual perception capabilities. To explore the potential of large multimodal models, Qwen2-VL investigates the scaling laws for large vision-language models (LVLMs). By scaling both the model size-with versions at 2B, 8B, and 72B parameters-and the amount of training data, the Qwen2-VL Series achieves highly competitive performance. Notably, the Qwen2-VL-72B model achieves results comparable to leading models such as GPT-4o and Claude3.5-Sonnet across various multimodal benchmarks, outperforming other generalist models.

    "abstract": "We introduce phi-3-mini, a 3.8 billion parameter language model trained on 3.3 trillion tokens, whose overall performance, as measured by both academic benchmarks and internal testing, rivals that of models such as Mixtral 8x7B and GPT-3.5 (e.g., phi-3-mini achieves 69% on MMLU and 8.38 on MT-bench), despite being small enough to be deployed on a phone. Our training dataset is a scaled-up version of the one used for phi-2, composed of heavily filtered publicly available web data and synthetic data. The model is also further aligned for robustness, safety, and chat format. We also provide parameter-scaling results with a 7B, 14B models trained for 4.8T tokens, called phi-3-small, phi-3-medium, both significantly more capable than phi-3-mini (e.g., respectively 75%, 78% on MMLU, and 8.7, 8.9 on MT-bench). To enhance multilingual, multimodal, and long-context capabilities, we introduce three models in the phi-3.5 series: phi-3.5-mini, phi-3.5-MoE, and phi-3.5-Vision. The phi-3.5-MoE, a 16 x 3.8B MoE model with 6.6 billion active parameters, achieves superior performance in language reasoning, math, and code tasks compared to other open-source models of similar scale, such as Llama 3.1 and the Mixtral series, and on par with Gemini-1.5-Flash and GPT-4o-mini. Meanwhile, phi-3.5-Vision, a 4.2 billion parameter model derived from phi-3.5-mini, excels in reasoning tasks and is adept at handling both single-image and text prompts, as well as multi-image and text prompts.",

To address this, we introduce the DeepSeek-Coder series, a range of open-source code models with sizes from 1.3B to 33B, trained from scratch on 2 trillion tokens. These models are pre-trained on a high-quality project-level code corpus and employ a fill-in-the-blank task with a 16K window to enhance code generation and infilling. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that DeepSeek-Coder not only achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source code models across multiple benchmarks but also surpasses existing closed-source models like Codex and GPT-3.5. Furthermore, DeepSeek-Coder models are under a permissive license that allows for both research and unrestricted commercial use.",

It comprises 236B total parameters, of which 21B are activated for each token, and supports a context length of 128K tokens. DeepSeek-V2 adopts innovative architectures including Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) and DeepSeekMoE. MLA guarantees efficient inference through significantly compressing the Key-Value (KV) cache into a latent vector, while DeepSeekMoE enables training strong models at an economical cost through sparse computation. Compared with DeepSeek 67B, DeepSeek-V2 achieves significantly stronger performance, and meanwhile saves 42.5% of training costs, reduces the KV cache by 93.3%, and boosts the maximum generation throughput to 5.76 times. We pretrain DeepSeek-V2 on a high-quality and multi-source corpus consisting of 8.1T tokens, and further perform Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) to fully unlock its potential. Evaluation results show that, even with only 21B activated parameters, DeepSeek-V2 and its chat versions still achieve top-tier performance among open-source models.",

    "abstract": "Recent progress in electronic skin or e\u2010skin research is broadly reviewed, focusing on technologies needed in three main applications: skin\u2010attachable electronics, robotics, and prosthetics. First, since e\u2010skin will be exposed to prolonged stresses of various kinds and needs to be conformally adhered to irregularly shaped surfaces, materials with intrinsic stretchability and self\u2010healing properties are of great importance. Second, tactile sensing capability such as the detection of pressure, strain, slip, force vector, and temperature are important for health monitoring in skin attachable devices, and to enable object manipulation and detection of surrounding environment for robotics and prosthetics. For skin attachable devices, chemical and electrophysiological sensing and wireless signal communication are of high significance to fully gauge the state of health of users and to ensure user comfort. For robotics and prosthetics, large\u2010area integration on 3D surfaces in a facile and scalable manner is critical. Furthermore, new signal processing strategies using neuromorphic devices are needed to efficiently process tactile information in a parallel and low power manner. For prosthetics, neural interfacing electrodes are of high importance. These topics are discussed, focusing on progress, current challenges, and future prospects.",

    "title": "Provably Efficient Reinforcement Learning with Linear Function Approximation",
    "abstract": "Modern reinforcement learning (RL) is commonly applied to practical problems with an enormous number of states, where function approximation must be deployed to approximate either the value function or the policy. The introduction of function approximation raises a fundamental set of challenges involving computational and statistical efficiency, especially given the need to manage the exploration/exploitation trade-off. As a result, a core RL question remains open: how can we design provably efficient RL algorithms that incorporate function approximation? This question persists even in a basic setting with linear dynamics and linear rewards, for which only linear function approximation is needed. This paper presents the first provable RL algorithm with both polynomial run time and polynomial sample complexity in this linear setting, without requiring a \u201csimulator\u201d or additional assumptions. Concretely, we prove that an optimistic modification of least-squares value iteration\u2014a classical algorithm frequently studied in the linear setting\u2014achieves [Formula: see text] regret, where d is the ambient dimension of feature space, H is the length of each episode, and T is the total number of steps. Importantly, such regret is independent of the number of states and actions. Funding: This work was supported by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency program on Lifelong Learning Machines.",

    "abstract": "We study offline reinforcement learning (RL), which aims to learn an optimal policy based on a dataset collected a priori. Due to the lack of further interactions with the environment, offline RL suffers from the insufficient coverage of the dataset, which eludes most existing theoretical analysis. In this paper, we propose a pessimistic variant of the value iteration algorithm (PEVI), which incorporates an uncertainty quantifier as the penalty function. Such a penalty function simply flips the sign of the bonus function for promoting exploration in online RL, which makes it easily implementable and compatible with general function approximators. Without assuming the sufficient coverage of the dataset, we establish a data-dependent upper bound on the suboptimality of PEVI for general Markov decision processes (MDPs). When specialized to linear MDPs, it matches the information-theoretic lower bound up to multiplicative factors of the dimension and horizon. In other words, pessimism is not only provably efficient but also minimax optimal. In particular, given the dataset, the learned policy serves as the\"best effort\"among all policies, as no other policies can do better. Our theoretical analysis identifies the critical role of pessimism in eliminating a notion of spurious correlation, which emerges from the\"irrelevant\"trajectories that are less covered by the dataset and not informative for the optimal policy.",

    "abstract": "Automatic transistor sizing is a challenging problem in circuit design due to the large design space, complex performance tradeoffs, and fast technology advancements. Although there have been plenty of work on transistor sizing targeting on one circuit, limited research has been done on transferring the knowledge from one circuit to another to reduce the re-design overhead. In this paper, we present GCN-RL Circuit Designer, leveraging reinforcement learning (RL) to transfer the knowledge between different technology nodes and topologies. Moreover, inspired by the simple fact that circuit is a graph, we learn on the circuit topology representation with graph convolutional neural networks (GCN). The GCN-RL agent extracts features of the topology graph whose vertices are transistors, edges are wires. Our learning-based optimization consistently achieves the highest Figures of Merit (FoM) on four different circuits compared with conventional black box optimization methods (Bayesian Optimization, Evolutionary Algorithms), random search and human expert designs. Experiments on transfer learning between five technology nodes and two circuit topologies demonstrate that RL with transfer learning can achieve much higher FoMs than methods without knowledge transfer. Our transferable optimization method makes transistor sizing and design porting more effective and efficient.",

    "abstract": "Safety remains a central obstacle preventing widespread use of RL in the real world: learning new tasks in uncertain environments requires extensive exploration, but safety requires limiting exploration. We propose Recovery RL, an algorithm which navigates this tradeoff by (1) leveraging offline data to learn about constraint violating zones before policy learning and (2) separating the goals of improving task performance and constraint satisfaction across two policies: a task policy that only optimizes the task reward and a recovery policy that guides the agent to safety when constraint violation is likely. We evaluate Recovery RL on 6 simulation domains, including two contact-rich manipulation tasks and an image-based navigation task, and an image-based obstacle avoidance task on a physical robot. We compare Recovery RL to 5 prior safe RL methods which jointly optimize for task performance and safety via constrained optimization or reward shaping and find that Recovery RL outperforms the next best prior method across all domains. Results suggest that Recovery RL trades off constraint violations and task successes 2\u201320 times more efficiently in simulation domains and 3 times more efficiently in physical experiments.

    "abstract": "Deep neural network based reinforcement learning (RL) can learn appropriate visual representations for complex tasks like vision-based robotic grasping without the need for manually engineering or prior learning a perception system. However, data for RL is collected via running an agent in the desired environment, and for applications like robotics, running a robot in the real world may be extremely costly and time consuming. Simulated training offers an appealing alternative, but ensuring that policies trained in simulation can transfer effectively into the real world requires additional machinery. Simulations may not match reality, and typically bridging the simulation-to-reality gap requires domain knowledge and task-specific engineering. We can automate this process by employing generative models to translate simulated images into realistic ones. However, this sort of translation is typically task-agnostic, in that the translated images may not preserve all features that are relevant to the task. In this paper, we introduce the RL-scene consistency loss for image translation, which ensures that the translation operation is invariant with respect to the Q-values associated with the image. This allows us to learn a task-aware translation. Incorporating this loss into unsupervised domain translation, we obtain the RL-CycleGAN, a new approach for simulation-to-real-world transfer for reinforcement learning. In evaluations of RL-CycleGAN on two vision-based robotics grasping tasks, we show that RL-CycleGAN offers a substantial improvement over a number of prior methods for sim-to-real transfer, attaining excellent real-world performance with only a modest number of real-world observations.",

Flexible human\u2013machine interfaces on soft robotics will make a promising alternative to conventional rigid devices, which can potentially revolutionize the paradigm and future direction of medical robotics in terms of rehabilitation feedback and user experience. In this review, the fundamental components of the materials, structures, and mechanisms in flexible human\u2010machine interfaces are summarized by recent and renowned applications in five primary areas: physical and chemical sensing, physiological recording, information processing and communication, soft robotic actuation, and feedback stimulation.

    "abstract": "Digital twin (DT) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have grown rapidly in recent years and are considered by both academia and industry to be key enablers for Industry 4.0. As a digital replica of a physical entity, the basis of DT is the infrastructure and data, the core is the algorithm and model, and the application is the software and service. The grounding of DT and AI in industrial sectors is even more dependent on the systematic and in-depth integration of domain-specific expertise. This survey comprehensively reviews over 300 manuscripts on AI-driven DT technologies of Industry 4.0 used over the past five years and summarizes their general developments and the current state of AI-integration in the fields of smart manufacturing and advanced robotics. These cover conventional sophisticated metal machining and industrial automation as well as emerging techniques, such as 3D printing and human\u2013robot interaction/cooperation. Furthermore, advantages of AI-driven DTs in the context of sustainable development are elaborated. Practical challenges and development prospects of AI-driven DTs are discussed with a respective focus on different levels. A route for AI-integration in multiscale/fidelity DTs with multiscale/fidelity data sources in Industry 4.0 is outlined.",

Our main result is a high probability regret upper bound of [Formula: see text] for any communicating MDP with S states, A actions, and diameter D. Here, regret compares the total reward achieved by the algorithm to the total expected reward of an optimal infinite-horizon undiscounted average reward policy in time horizon T. This result closely matches the known lower bound of [Formula: see text]. Our techniques involve proving some novel results about the anti-concentration of Dirichlet distribution, which may be of independent interest.",

    "abstract": "This work identifies a common flaw of deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms: a tendency to rely on early interactions and ignore useful evidence encountered later. Because of training on progressively growing datasets, deep RL agents incur a risk of overfitting to earlier experiences, negatively affecting the rest of the learning process. Inspired by cognitive science, we refer to this effect as the primacy bias. Through a series of experiments, we dissect the algorithmic aspects of deep RL that exacerbate this bias. We then propose a simple yet generally-applicable mechanism that tackles the primacy bias by periodically resetting a part of the agent. We apply this mechanism to algorithms in both discrete (Atari 100k) and continuous action (DeepMind Control Suite) domains, consistently improving their performance.",

    "abstract": "We propose Algorithm Distillation (AD), a method for distilling reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms into neural networks by modeling their training histories with a causal sequence model. Algorithm Distillation treats learning to reinforcement learn as an across-episode sequential prediction problem. A dataset of learning histories is generated by a source RL algorithm, and then a causal transformer is trained by autoregressively predicting actions given their preceding learning histories as context. Unlike sequential policy prediction architectures that distill post-learning or expert sequences, AD is able to improve its policy entirely in-context without updating its network parameters. We demonstrate that AD can reinforcement learn in-context in a variety of environments with sparse rewards, combinatorial task structure, and pixel-based observations, and find that AD learns a more data-efficient RL algorithm than the one that generated the source data.",

    "abstract": "Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to find performant policies from logged data without further environment interaction. Model-based algorithms, which learn a model of the environment from the dataset and perform conservative policy optimisation within that model, have emerged as a promising approach to this problem. In this work, we present Robust Adversarial Model-Based Offline RL (RAMBO), a novel approach to model-based offline RL. We formulate the problem as a two-player zero sum game against an adversarial environment model. The model is trained to minimise the value function while still accurately predicting the transitions in the dataset, forcing the policy to act conservatively in areas not covered by the dataset. To approximately solve the two-player game, we alternate between optimising the policy and adversarially optimising the model. The problem formulation that we address is theoretically grounded, resulting in a probably approximately correct (PAC) performance guarantee and a pessimistic value function which lower bounds the value function in the true environment. We evaluate our approach on widely studied offline RL benchmarks, and demonstrate that it outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines.",

    "abstract": "Digital transformation (DT) has become a buzzword, triggering different disciplines in research and influencing practice, which leads to independent research streams. Scholars investigate the antecedents, contingencies, and consequences of these disruptive technologies by examining the use of single technologies or of digitization, in general. Approaches are often very specialized and restricted to their domains. Thus, the immense breadth of technologies and their possible applications conditions a fragmentation of research, impeding a holistic view. With this systematic literature review, we aim to fill this gap in providing an overview of the different disciplines of DT research from a holistic business perspective. We identified the major research streams and clustered them with co-citation network analysis in nine main areas. Our research shows the main fields of interest in digital transformation research, overlaps of the research areas and fields that are still underrepresented. Within the business research areas, we identified three dominant areas in literature: finance, marketing, and innovation management. However, research streams also arise in terms of single branches like manufacturing or tourism. This study highlights these diverse research streams with the aim of deepening the understanding of digital transformation in research. Yet, research on DT still lacks in the areas of accounting, human resource management, and sustainability. The findings were distilled into a framework of the nine main areas for assisting the implications on potential research gaps on DT from a business perspective.",

    "abstract": "The architecture of mouse and human antibody repertoires is defined by the sequence similarity networks of the clones that compose them. The major principles that define the architecture of antibody repertoires have remained largely unknown. Here, we establish a high-performance computing platform to construct large-scale networks from comprehensive human and murine antibody repertoire sequencing datasets (>100,000 unique sequences). Leveraging a network-based statistical framework, we identify three fundamental principles of antibody repertoire architecture: reproducibility, robustness and redundancy. Antibody repertoire networks are highly reproducible across individuals despite high antibody sequence dissimilarity. The architecture of antibody repertoires is robust to the removal of up to 50\u201390% of randomly selected clones, but fragile to the removal of public clones shared among individuals. Finally, repertoire architecture is intrinsically redundant. Our analysis provides guidelines for the large-scale network analysis of immune repertoires and may be used in the future to define disease-associated and synthetic repertoires. Analysis of large-scale immune repertoire architecture remains a challenge. Here, the authors introduce an approach to construct similarity networks from high-throughput antibody repertoire sequencing data, and show that the networks are redundant, robust and reproducible across individuals.",

    "abstract": "Asynchronous Learning Networks (ALNs) make the process of collaboration more transparent, because a transcript of conference messages can be used to assess individual roles and contributions and the collaborative process itself. This study considers three aspects of ALNs: the design; the quality of the resulting knowledge construction process; and cohesion, role and power network structures. The design is evaluated according to the Social Interdependence Theory of CooperativeLearning. The quality of the knowledge construction process is evaluated through Content Analysis; and the network structures are analyzed using Social Network Analysis of the response relations among participants during online discussions. In this research we analyze data from two three-monthlong ALN academic university courses: a formal, structured, closed forum and an informal, nonstructured, open forum. We found that in the structured ALN, the knowledge construction processreached a very high phase of critical thinking and developed cohesive cliques. The students took on bridging and triggering roles, while the tutor had relatively little power. In the non-structured ALN, the knowledge construction process reached a low phase of cognitive activity; few cliques were constructed; most of the students took on the passive role of teacher-followers; and the tutor was at the center of activity. These differences are statistically significant. We conclude that a well-designed ALN develops significant, distinct cohesion, and role and power structures lead the knowledge construction process to high phases of critical thinking.",

    "abstract": "Rocks of Ediacaran age (~635\u2013541\u2009Ma) contain the oldest fossils of large, complex organisms and their behaviors. These fossils document developmental and ecological innovations, and suggest that extinctions helped to shape the trajectory of early animal evolution. Conventional methods divide Ediacaran macrofossil localities into taxonomically distinct clusters, which may represent evolutionary, environmental, or preservational variation. Here, we investigate these possibilities with network analysis of body and trace fossil occurrences. By partitioning multipartite networks of taxa, paleoenvironments, and geologic formations into community units, we distinguish between biostratigraphic zones and paleoenvironmentally restricted biotopes, and provide empirically robust and statistically significant evidence for a global, cosmopolitan assemblage unique to terminal Ediacaran strata. The assemblage is taxonomically depauperate but includes fossils of recognizable eumetazoans, which lived between two episodes of biotic turnover. These turnover events were the first major extinctions of complex life and paved the way for the Cambrian radiation of animals. The Ediacara biota\u2014the first large, complex organisms to evolve on Earth\u2014disappeared prior to the radiation of animals during the Cambrian Period. Here, Muscente et al. perform network analysis of Ediacaran fossils and show that there were two global extinction events before the Cambrian radiation.",

The tool (InfraNodus) can be used by researchers and writers to organize and to better understand their notes, to measure the level of bias in discourse, and to identify the parts of the discourse where there is a potential for insight and new ideas. The method is based on text network analysis algorithm, which represents any text as a network and identifies the most influential words in a discourse based on the terms' co-occurrence. Graph community detection algorithm is then applied in order to identify the different topical clusters, which represent the main topics in the text as well as the relations between them. The community structure is used in conjunction with other measures to identify the level of bias or cognitive diversity of the discourse. Finally, the structural gaps in the graph can indicate the parts of the discourse where the connections are lacking, therefore highlighting the areas where there's a potential for new ideas. The tool can be used as stand-alone software by end users as well as implemented via an API into other tools. Another interesting application is in the field of recommendation systems: structural gaps could indicate potentially interesting non-trivial connections to any connected datasets.",

    "abstract": "Multivariate time-series forecasting plays a crucial role in many real-world applications. It is a challenging problem as one needs to consider both intra-series temporal correlations and inter-series correlations simultaneously. Recently, there have been multiple works trying to capture both correlations, but most, if not all of them only capture temporal correlations in the time domain and resort to pre-defined priors as inter-series relationships. In this paper, we propose Spectral Temporal Graph Neural Network (StemGNN) to further improve the accuracy of multivariate time-series forecasting. StemGNN captures inter-series correlations and temporal dependencies jointly in the spectral domain. It combines Graph Fourier Transform (GFT) which models inter-series correlations and Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) which models temporal dependencies in an end-to-end framework. After passing through GFT and DFT, the spectral representations hold clear patterns and can be predicted effectively by convolution and sequential learning modules. Moreover, StemGNN learns inter-series correlations automatically from the data without using pre-defined priors. We conduct extensive experiments on ten real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of StemGNN.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how certain brain regions relate to a specific neurological disorder or cognitive stimuli has been an important area of neuroimaging research. We propose BrainGNN, a graph neural network (GNN) framework to analyze functional magnetic resonance images (fMRI) and discover neurological biomarkers. Considering the special property of brain graphs, we design novel ROI-aware graph convolutional (Ra-GConv) layers that leverage the topological and functional information of fMRI. Motivated by the need for transparency in medical image analysis, our BrainGNN contains ROI-selection pooling layers (R-pool) that highlight salient ROIs (nodes in the graph), so that we can infer which ROIs are important for prediction. Furthermore, we propose regularization terms - unit loss, topK pooling (TPK) loss and group-level consistency (GLC) loss - on pooling results to encourage reasonable ROI-selection and provide flexibility to preserve either individual- or group-level patterns. We apply the BrainGNN framework on two independent fMRI datasets: Autism Spectral Disorder (ASD) fMRI dataset and Human Connectome Project (HCP) 900 Subject Release. We investigate different choices of the hyperparameters and show that BrainGNN outperforms the alternative fMRI image analysis methods in terms of four different evaluation metrics. The obtained community clustering and salient ROI detection results show high correspondence with the previous neuroimaging-derived evidence of biomarkers for ASD and specific task states decoded for HCP.",

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely applied to fraud detection problems in recent years, revealing the suspiciousness of nodes by aggregating their neighborhood information via different relations. However, few prior works have noticed the camouflage behavior of fraudsters, which could hamper the performance of GNN-based fraud detectors during the aggregation process. In this paper, we introduce two types of camouflages based on recent empirical studies, i.e., the feature camouflage and the relation camouflage. Existing GNNs have not addressed these two camouflages, which results in their poor performance in fraud detection problems. Alternatively, we propose a new model named CAmouflage-REsistant GNN (CARE-GNN), to enhance the GNN aggregation process with three unique modules against camouflages. Concretely, we first devise a label-aware similarity measure to find informative neighboring nodes. Then, we leverage reinforcement learning (RL) to find the optimal amounts of neighbors to be selected. Finally, the selected neighbors across different relations are aggregated together. Comprehensive experiments on two real-world fraud datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the RL algorithm. The proposed CARE-GNN also outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs and GNN-based fraud detectors. We integrate all GNN-based fraud detectors as an opensource toolbox https://github.com/safe-graph/DGFraud. The CARE-GNN code and datasets are available at https://github.com/YingtongDou/CARE-GNN.",

    "abstract": "While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable results in a variety of applications, recent studies exposed important shortcomings in their ability to capture the structure of the underlying graph. It has been shown that the expressive power of standard GNNs is bounded by the Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) graph isomorphism test, from which they inherit proven limitations such as the inability to detect and count graph substructures. On the other hand, there is significant empirical evidence, e.g. in network science and bioinformatics, that substructures are often intimately related to downstream tasks. To this end, we propose \u201dGraph Substructure Networks\u201d (GSN), a topologically-aware message passing scheme based on substructure encoding. We theoretically analyse the expressive power of our architecture, showing that it is strictly more expressive than the WL test, and provide sufficient conditions for universality. Importantly, we do not attempt to adhere to the WL hierarchy; this allows us to retain multiple attractive properties of standard GNNs such as locality and linear network complexity, while being able to disambiguate even hard instances of graph isomorphism. We perform an extensive experimental evaluation on graph classification and regression tasks and obtain state-of-the-art results in diverse real-world settings including molecular graphs and social networks.",

    "title": "DistDGL: Distributed Graph Neural Network Training for Billion-Scale Graphs",
    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNN) have shown great success in learning from graph-structured data. They are widely used in various applications, such as recommendation, fraud detection, and search. In these domains, the graphs are typically large, containing hundreds of millions of nodes and several billions of edges. To tackle this challenge, we develop DistDGL, a system for training GNNs in a mini-batch fashion on a cluster of machines. DistDGL is based on the Deep Graph Library (DGL), a popular GNN development framework. DistDGL distributes the graph and its associated data (initial features and embeddings) across the machines and uses this distribution to derive a computational decomposition by following an owner-compute rule. DistDGL follows a synchronous training approach and allows ego-networks forming the mini-batches to include non-local nodes. To minimize the overheads associated with distributed computations, DistDGL uses a high-quality and light-weight min-cut graph partitioning algorithm along with multiple balancing constraints. This allows it to reduce communication overheads and statically balance the computations. It further reduces the communication by replicating halo nodes and by using sparse embedding updates. The combination of these design choices allows DistDGL to train high-quality models while achieving high parallel efficiency and memory scalability. We demonstrate our optimizations on both inductive and transductive GNN models. Our results show that DistDGL achieves linear speedup without compromising model accuracy and requires only 13 seconds to complete a training epoch for a graph with 100 million nodes and 3 billion edges on a cluster with 16 machines.",

    "abstract": "Given high-dimensional time series data (e.g., sensor data), how can we detect anomalous events, such as system faults and attacks? More challengingly, how can we do this in a way that captures complex inter-sensor relationships, and detects and explains anomalies which deviate from these relationships? Recently, deep learning approaches have enabled improvements in anomaly detection in high-dimensional datasets; however, existing methods do not explicitly learn the structure of existing relationships between variables, or use them to predict the expected behavior of time series. Our approach combines a structure learning approach with graph neural networks, additionally using attention weights to provide explainability for the detected anomalies. Experiments on two real-world sensor datasets with ground truth anomalies show that our method detects anomalies more accurately than baseline approaches, accurately captures correlations between sensors, and allows users to deduce the root cause of a detected anomaly.",

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNN) have been shown to provide substantial performance improvements for atomistic material representation and modeling compared with descriptor-based machine learning models. While most existing GNN models for atomistic predictions are based on atomic distance information, they do not explicitly incorporate bond angles, which are critical for distinguishing many atomic structures. Furthermore, many material properties are known to be sensitive to slight changes in bond angles. We present an Atomistic Line Graph Neural Network (ALIGNN), a GNN architecture that performs message passing on both the interatomic bond graph and its line graph corresponding to bond angles. We demonstrate that angle information can be explicitly and efficiently included, leading to improved performance on multiple atomistic prediction tasks. We ALIGNN models for predicting 52 solid-state and molecular properties available in the JARVIS-DFT, Materials project, and QM9 databases. ALIGNN can outperform some previously reported GNN models on atomistic prediction tasks by up to 85% in accuracy with better or comparable model training speed.",

    "title": "Self-supervised Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network with Co-contrastive Learning",
    "abstract": "Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) as an emerging technique have shown superior capacity of dealing with heterogeneous information network (HIN). However, most HGNNs follow a semi-supervised learning manner, which notably limits their wide use in reality since labels are usually scarce in real applications. Recently, contrastive learning, a self-supervised method, becomes one of the most exciting learning paradigms and shows great potential when there are no labels. In this paper, we study the problem of self-supervised HGNNs and propose a novel co-contrastive learning mechanism for HGNNs, named HeCo. Different from traditional contrastive learning which only focuses on contrasting positive and negative samples, HeCo employs cross-view contrastive mechanism. Specifically, two views of a HIN (network schema and meta-path views) are proposed to learn node embeddings, so as to capture both of local and high-order structures simultaneously. Then the cross-view contrastive learning, as well as a view mask mechanism, is proposed, which is able to extract the positive and negative embeddings from two views. This enables the two views to collaboratively supervise each other and finally learn high-level node embeddings. Moreover, two extensions of HeCo are designed to generate harder negative samples with high quality, which further boosts the performance of HeCo. Extensive experiments conducted on a variety of real-world networks show the superior performance of the proposed methods over the state-of-the-arts.",

    "abstract": "Link prediction is a very fundamental task on graphs. Inspired by traditional path-based methods, in this paper we propose a general and flexible representation learning framework based on paths for link prediction. Specifically, we define the representation of a pair of nodes as the generalized sum of all path representations, with each path representation as the generalized product of the edge representations in the path. Motivated by the Bellman-Ford algorithm for solving the shortest path problem, we show that the proposed path formulation can be efficiently solved by the generalized Bellman-Ford algorithm. To further improve the capacity of the path formulation, we propose the Neural Bellman-Ford Network (NBFNet), a general graph neural network framework that solves the path formulation with learned operators in the generalized Bellman-Ford algorithm. The NBFNet parameterizes the generalized Bellman-Ford algorithm with 3 neural components, namely INDICATOR, MESSAGE and AGGREGATE functions, which corresponds to the boundary condition, multiplication operator, and summation operator respectively. The NBFNet is very general, covers many traditional path-based methods, and can be applied to both homogeneous graphs and multi-relational graphs (e.g., knowledge graphs) in both transductive and inductive settings. Experiments on both homogeneous graphs and knowledge graphs show that the proposed NBFNet outperforms existing methods by a large margin in both transductive and inductive settings, achieving new state-of-the-art results.",

    "abstract": "Background Exposure to visual posts featuring e-cigarette products on social media is associated with increased e-cigarette use among US adolescents. Instagram is the largest source of e-cigarette social media marketing, where influencers\u2014for example, bloggers, brand ambassadors\u2014post promotional materials. This study analysed the network of e-cigarette brands and influencers on Instagram, characterising the most central players in e-cigarette social media marketing. Methods We tracked influencers with public profiles on Instagram who posted promotional e-cigarette content in 2020, had over 1000 followers and high user engagement rate (ratio of likes and comments to followers) of 1%\u201325% per post. By conducting a social network analysis, we identified the most central (highly involved in promotional activities) influencers and e-cigarette brands. The number of the influencers\u2019 followers aged 13\u201317 years old and the age verification practices restricting youth access were also assessed. Results There is a highly interconnected network of engaging e-cigarette influencers (n=55) worldwide who collaborated with over 600 e-cigarette brands in 2020. The Asian and US influencers had five to six times more teenage followers compared with the European influencers. 75% of the influencers did not restrict youth access to their promotional content on Instagram. The brands Voopotech, Innokin, Geekvape, Lost Vape, Smok and Vaporesso collaborated with the largest number of influencers (mean n=20). Conclusions It is important to understand associations among influencers and e-cigarette use behaviours, especially youth, to inform effective public health communication and potential policies that could regulate social media marketing sponsored by e-cigarette companies.",

    "abstract": "Background Uveal melanoma(UVM) is the most common intraocular malignancy and has a poor prognosis. The clinical significance of necroptosis(NCPS) in UVM is unclear. Methods We first identified necroptosis genes in UVM by single-cell analysis of the GSE139829 dataset from the GEO database and weighted co-expression network analysis of TCGA data. COX regression and Lasso regression were used to construct the prognostic model. Then survival analysis, immune microenvironment analysis, and mutation analysis were carried out. Finally, cell experiments were performed to verify the role of ITPA in UVM. Result By necroptosis-related prognostic model, UVM patients in both TCGA and GEO cohorts could be classified as high-NCPS and low-NCPS groups, with significant differences in survival time between the two groups (P<0.001). Besides, the high-NCPS group had higher levels of immune checkpoint-related gene expression, suggesting that they might be more likely to benefit from immunotherapy. The cell experiments confirmed the role of ITPA, the most significant gene in the model, in UVM. After ITPA was knocked down, the activity, proliferation, and invasion ability of the MuM-2B cell line were significantly reduced. Conclusion Our study can provide a reference for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with UVM.",

    "abstract": "The validation of the Bergen Social Media Addiction Scale (BSMAS) in different cultural contexts is contributory in adding to the extant research body on psychometric qualities of the scale. The main purpose of this study was to examine the validity of the BSMAS, based on classical test theory and advanced psychometric testing, namely item response theory (IRT) and network analysis in a Romanian sample of 705 participants (39% males, aged 18\u201354\u00a0years, M \u2009=\u200930.24, SD \u2009\u00b1\u20099.15). Composite reliability and McDonald\u2019s omega proved the very good internal consistency of the BSMAS-RO. The CFA highlighted the unifactorial model fitted well and measurement invariance across gender was revealed. Females obtained significantly higher scores on social media addiction (SMA) than males. As for concurrent validity, SMA correlated with social media intensity use, anxious attachment, social anxiety, need to belong, self-esteem, and happiness. IRT analysis proved adequate discrimination and difficulty parameters for all items. The highest discrimination was registered by salience criterion and the highest difficulty by conflict, withdrawal, and mood modification criteria. Relapse criterion had the lowest values of both parameters. Network analysis revealed that salience and withdrawal criteria had the highest indicators of centrality and relapse the lowest. Our findings revealed that the most relevant criteria to the diagnosis of SMA in Romanian people are salience, conflict, withdrawal, and mood modification. The robust psychometric properties of the BSMAS-RO provide health professionals a valid instrument for assessing SMA. Programs to prevent SMA must focus on dispositional traits as AATT, social anxiety, respectively unsatisfied need to belong, and promoting the ability to initiate and maintain rewarding social relationships.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Blockchain represents an evolving technology for distributed and secure recording and sharing of information. Meanwhile, blockchain has thrived in banking, finance, and supply chain; its usage within the construction industry is still in its infancy. To this end, the existing literature falls short in providing comprehensive quantitative understanding, within a systems-based analytic context, of the factors affecting blockchain utilization in construction applications. This paper fills this knowledge gap. The authors: (1) conducted an extensive literature review on blockchain implementation in the construction domain; (2) identified a list of 41 factors affecting blockchain implementation in construction projects categorized in four categories: challenges, needs, requirements, and capabilities; (3) utilized a social network analysis (SNA) approach on a database of 111 publications to quantitatively analyze the literature as related to the aforementioned factors; and (4) performed clustering analysis on the SNA graphs to determine the combinations of factors that are most likely co-occurring in research publications. SNA results indicate that while the most investigated factor was \u201cincreased trust and transparency between project parties\u201d, the least studied factors included: \u201ccash upfront funding system\u201d, \u201cchange payment processes and procedures\u201d, \u201csmart contracts design errors\u201d, \u201ccryptocurrency fluctuations\u201d, \u201clack of sufficiently skilled personnel\u201d, and \u201cincreased awareness and capabilities of personnel\u201d. Also, clustering outcomes highlight that some combinations of factors are not well-represented in current scholarly efforts. Such imbalance and consequent knowledge gaps may contribute to the actual implementation rate of blockchain in construction applications. Ultimately, this paper provides a roadmap for potential future directions of blockchain construction-related research.",

    "abstract": "Social networks now connect billions of people around the world, where individuals occupying different positions often represent different social roles and show different characteristics in their behaviors. The structural hole (SH) theory demonstrates that users occupying the bridging positions between different communities have advantages since they control the key information diffusion paths. Users of this type, known as SH spanners, are important when it comes to assimilating social network structures and user behaviors. In this article, we review the use of SHs theory in social network analysis, where SH spanners take advantage of both information and control benefits. We investigate the existing algorithms of SH spanner detection and classify them into information flow-based algorithms and network centrality-based algorithms. For practitioners, we further illustrate the applications of SH theory in various practical scenarios, including enterprise settings, information diffusion in social networks, software development, mobile applications, and machine learning (ML)-based social prediction. Our review provides a comprehensive discussion on the foundation, detection, and practical applications of SHs. The insights can facilitate researchers and service providers to better apply the theory and derive value-added tools with advanced ML techniques. To inspire follow-up research, we identify potential research trends in this area, especially on the dynamics of networks.",

    "abstract": "Despite recent progress, machine learning methods remain inadequate in modeling the natural protein-protein interaction (PPI) hierarchy for PPI prediction. Here, the authors present a double-viewed hierarchical graph learning model, HIGH-PPI, to predict PPIs and extrapolate the molecular details involved. Protein-Protein Interactions (PPIs) are fundamental means of functions and signalings in biological systems. The massive growth in demand and cost associated with experimental PPI studies calls for computational tools for automated prediction and understanding of PPIs. Despite recent progress, in silico methods remain inadequate in modeling the natural PPI hierarchy. Here we present a double-viewed hierarchical graph learning model, HIGH-PPI, to predict PPIs and extrapolate the molecular details involved. In this model, we create a hierarchical graph, in which a node in the PPI network (top outside-of-protein view) is a protein graph (bottom inside-of-protein view). In the bottom view, a group of chemically relevant descriptors, instead of the protein sequences, are used to better capture the structure-function relationship of the protein. HIGH-PPI examines both outside-of-protein and inside-of-protein of the human interactome to establish a robust machine understanding of PPIs. This model demonstrates high accuracy and robustness in predicting PPIs. Moreover, HIGH-PPI can interpret the modes of action of PPIs by identifying important binding and catalytic sites precisely.

    "abstract": "We propose DyGFormer, a new Transformer-based architecture for dynamic graph learning. DyGFormer is conceptually simple and only needs to learn from nodes' historical first-hop interactions by: (1) a neighbor co-occurrence encoding scheme that explores the correlations of the source node and destination node based on their historical sequences; (2) a patching technique that divides each sequence into multiple patches and feeds them to Transformer, allowing the model to effectively and efficiently benefit from longer histories. We also introduce DyGLib, a unified library with standard training pipelines, extensible coding interfaces, and comprehensive evaluating protocols to promote reproducible, scalable, and credible dynamic graph learning research. By performing exhaustive experiments on thirteen datasets for dynamic link prediction and dynamic node classification tasks, we find that DyGFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on most of the datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing nodes' correlations and long-term temporal dependencies. Moreover, some results of baselines are inconsistent with previous reports, which may be caused by their diverse but less rigorous implementations, showing the importance of DyGLib.

    "abstract": "With the springing up of face synthesis techniques, it is prominent in need to develop powerful face forgery detection methods due to security concerns. Some existing methods attempt to employ auxiliary frequency-aware information combined with CNN backbones to discover the forged clues. Due to the inadequate information interaction with image content, the extracted frequency features are thus spatially irrelavant, struggling to generalize well on increasingly realistic counterfeit types. To address this issue, we propose a Spatial-Frequency Dynamic Graph method to exploit the relation-aware features in spatial and frequency domains via dynamic graph learning. To this end, we introduce three well-designed components: 1) Content-guided Adaptive Frequency Extraction module to mine the content-adaptive forged frequency clues. 2) Multiple Domains Attention Map Learning module to enrich the spatial-frequency contextual features with multiscale attention maps. 3) Dynamic Graph Spatial-Frequency Feature Fusion Network to explore the high-order relation of spatial and frequency features. Extensive experiments on several benchmark show that our proposed method sustainedly exceeds the state-of-the-arts by a considerable margin.",

    "title": "Self-Supervised Temporal Graph Learning With Temporal and Structural Intensity Alignment",
    "abstract": "Temporal graph learning aims to generate high-quality representations for graph-based tasks with dynamic information, which has recently garnered increasing attention. In contrast to static graphs, temporal graphs are typically organized as node interaction sequences over continuous time rather than an adjacency matrix. Most temporal graph learning methods model current interactions by incorporating historical neighborhood. However, such methods only consider first-order temporal information while disregarding crucial high-order structural information, resulting in suboptimal performance. To address this issue, we propose a self-supervised method called S2T for temporal graph learning, which extracts both temporal and structural information to learn more informative node representations. Notably, the initial node representations combine first-order temporal and high-order structural information differently to calculate two conditional intensities. An alignment loss is then introduced to optimize the node representations, narrowing the gap between the two intensities and making them more informative. Concretely, in addition to modeling temporal information using historical neighbor sequences, we further consider structural knowledge at both local and global levels. At the local level, we generate structural intensity by aggregating features from high-order neighbor sequences. At the global level, a global representation is generated based on all nodes to adjust the structural intensity according to the active statuses on different nodes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed model S2T achieves at most 10.13% performance improvement compared with the state-of-the-art competitors on several datasets.",

    "title": "Generative-Contrastive Graph Learning for Recommendation",
    "abstract": "By treating users' interactions as a user-item graph, graph learning models have been widely deployed in Collaborative Filtering~(CF) based recommendation. Recently, researchers have introduced Graph Contrastive Learning~(GCL) techniques into CF to alleviate the sparse supervision issue, which first constructs contrastive views by data augmentations and then provides self-supervised signals by maximizing the mutual information between contrastive views. Despite the effectiveness, we argue that current GCL-based recommendation models are still limited as current data augmentation techniques, either structure augmentation or feature augmentation. First, structure augmentation randomly dropout nodes or edges, which is easy to destroy the intrinsic nature of the user-item graph. Second, feature augmentation imposes the same scale noise augmentation on each node, which neglects the unique characteristics of nodes on the graph. To tackle the above limitations, we propose a novel Variational Graph Generative-Contrastive Learning (VGCL) framework for recommendation. Specifically, we leverage variational graph reconstruction to estimate a Gaussian distribution of each node, then generate multiple contrastive views through multiple samplings from the estimated distributions, which builds a bridge between generative and contrastive learning. The generated contrastive views can well reconstruct the input graph without information distortion. Besides, the estimated variances are tailored to each node, which regulates the scale of contrastive loss for each node on optimization. Considering the similarity of the estimated distributions, we propose a cluster-aware twofold contrastive learning, a node-level to encourage consistency of a node's contrastive views and a cluster-level to encourage consistency of nodes in a cluster. Finally, extensive experimental results on three public datasets clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.",

Given high-dimensional MTS data, researchers generally rely on deep learning models to learn representative features. Among them, the methods that can capture the spatial\u2013temporal dependencies within MTS data generally achieve better performance. However, they ignored hierarchical relations and the dynamic property within MTS data, hindering their performance. To address these problems, we propose a hierarchical correlation pooling boosted graph neural network for MTS data representation learning. First, we propose a novel correlation pooling scheme to learn and capture hierarchical correlations between sensors. Meanwhile, a new assignment matrix is designed to ensure the effective learning of hierarchical correlations by adaptively combining both sensor features and correlations. Second, we learn sequential graphs to represent the dynamic property within MTS data, so that this property can be captured for learning decent representations. We conducted extensive experiments to test our model on various MTS tasks, including remaining useful life prediction, human activity recognition, and sleep stage classification. Experimental results have shown the effectiveness of our proposed model.",

An essential component in the process of materials discovery is to know which material(s) will possess desirable properties. For many materials properties, performing experiments and density functional theory computations are costly and time-consuming. Hence, it is challenging to build accurate predictive models for such properties using conventional data mining methods due to the small amount of available data. Here we present a framework for materials property prediction tasks using structure information that leverages graph neural network-based architecture along with deep-transfer-learning techniques to drastically improve the model\u2019s predictive ability on diverse materials (3D/2D, inorganic/organic, computational/experimental) data. We evaluated the proposed framework in cross-property and cross-materials class scenarios using 115 datasets to find that transfer learning models outperform the models trained from scratch in 104 cases, i.e., \u224890%, with additional benefits in performance for extrapolation problems.

    "abstract": "This paper investigates traffic forecasting, which attempts to forecast the future state of traffic based on historical situations. This problem has received ever-increasing attention in various scenarios and facilitated the development of numerous downstream applications such as urban planning and transportation management. However, the efficacy of existing methods remains sub-optimal due to their tendency to model temporal and spatial relationships independently, thereby inadequately accounting for complex high-order interactions of both worlds. Moreover, the diversity of transitional patterns in traffic forecasting makes them challenging to capture for existing approaches, warranting a deeper exploration of their diversity. Toward this end, this paper proposes Conjoint Spatio-Temporal graph neural network (abbreviated as COOL), which models heterogeneous graphs from prior and posterior information to conjointly capture high-order spatio-temporal relationships. On the one hand, heterogeneous graphs connecting sequential observation are constructed to extract composite spatio-temporal relationships via prior message passing. On the other hand, we model dynamic relationships using constructed affinity and penalty graphs, which guide posterior message passing to incorporate complementary semantic information into node representations. Moreover, to capture diverse transitional properties to enhance traffic forecasting, we propose a conjoint self-attention decoder that models diverse temporal patterns from both multi-rank and multi-scale views. Experimental results on four popular benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed COOL provides state-of-the-art performance compared with the competitive baselines.",

    "abstract": "\n Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network (STGNN) has been used as a common workhorse for traffic forecasting. However, most of them require prohibitive quadratic computational complexity to capture long-range spatio-temporal dependencies, thus hindering their applications to long historical sequences on large-scale road networks in the real-world. To this end, in this paper, we propose BigST, a linear complexity spatio-temporal graph neural network, to efficiently exploit long-range spatio-temporal dependencies for large-scale traffic forecasting. Specifically, we first propose a scalable long sequence feature extractor to encode node-wise long-range inputs (\n e.g.\n , thousands of time-steps in the past week) into low-dimensional representations encompassing rich temporal dynamics. The resulting representations can be pre-computed and hence significantly reduce the computational overhead for prediction. Then, we build a linearized global spatial convolution network to adaptively distill time-varying graph structures, which enables fast runtime message passing along spatial dimensions in linear complexity. We empirically evaluate our model on two large-scale real-world traffic datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BigST can scale to road networks with up to one hundred thousand nodes, while significantly improving prediction accuracy and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art traffic forecasting models.\n",

    "abstract": "The stock market is a crucial component of the financial system, but predicting the movement of stock prices is challenging due to the dynamic and intricate relations arising from various aspects such as economic indicators, financial reports, global news, and investor sentiment. Traditional sequential methods and graph-based models have been applied in stock movement prediction, but they have limitations in capturing the multifaceted and temporal influences in stock price movements. To address these challenges, the Multi-relational Dynamic Graph Neural Network (MDGNN) framework is proposed, which utilizes a discrete dynamic graph to comprehensively capture multifaceted relations among stocks and their evolution over time. The representation generated from the graph offers a complete perspective on the interrelationships among stocks and associated entities. Additionally, the power of the Transformer structure is leveraged to encode the temporal evolution of multiplex relations, providing a dynamic and effective approach to predicting stock investment. Further, our proposed MDGNN framework achieves the best performance in public datasets compared with the state-of-the-art stock investment methods.",

    "abstract": "Computational Biology is a fast-growing field that is enriched by different data-driven methodological approaches and by findings and applications in a broad range of biological areas. Fundamental to these approaches are the mathematical and computational models used to describe the different states at microscopic (for example a biochemical reaction), mesoscopic (the signalling effects at tissue level), and macroscopic levels (physiological and pathological effects) of biological processes. In this paper we address the problem of combining two powerful classes of methodologies: Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) methods which are now producing a revolution in biotechnology and medicine, and Petri Nets (PNs) which allow system generalisation and are central to various mathematical treatments, for example Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) specification of the biosystem under study. While the former is limited to modelling metabolic networks, i.e. does not account for intermittent dynamical signalling events, the latter is hampered by the need for a large amount of metabolic data. A first result presented in this paper is the identification of three types of cross-talks between PNs and FBA methods and their dependencies on available data. We exemplify our insights with the analysis of a pancreatic cancer model. We discuss how our reasoning framework provides a biologically and mathematically grounded decision making setting for the integration of regulatory, signalling, and metabolic networks and greatly increases model interpretability and reusability. We discuss how the parameters of PN and FBA models can be tuned and combined together so to highlight the computational effort needed to perform this task. We conclude with speculations and suggestions on this new promising research direction.",

    "abstract": "Patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are generally older and have more comorbidities. Therefore, identifying personalized treatment options for each patient early and accurately is essential. To address this, we developed a computational biology modeling (CBM) and digital drug simulation platform that relies on somatic gene mutations and gene CNVs found in malignant cells of individual patients. Drug treatment simulations based on unique patient-specific disease networks were used to generate treatment predictions. To evaluate the accuracy of the genomics-informed computational platform, we conducted a pilot prospective clinical study (NCT02435550) enrolling confirmed MDS and AML patients. Blinded to the empirically prescribed treatment regimen for each patient, genomic data from 50 evaluable patients were analyzed by CBM to predict patient-specific treatment responses. CBM accurately predicted treatment responses in 55 of 61 (90%) simulations, with 33 of 61 true positives, 22 of 61 true negatives, 3 of 61 false positives, and 3 of 61 false negatives, resulting in a sensitivity of 94%, a specificity of 88%, and an accuracy of 90%. Laboratory validation further confirmed the accuracy of CBM-predicted activated protein networks in 17 of 19 (89%) samples from 11 patients. Somatic mutations in the TET2, IDH1/2, ASXL1, and EZH2 genes were discovered to be highly informative of MDS response to hypomethylating agents. In sum, analyses of patient cancer genomics using the CBM platform can be used to predict precision treatment responses in MDS and AML patients.",

    "title": "Object Weighting: A New Clustering Approach to Deal with Outliers and Cluster Overlap in Computational Biology",
    "abstract": "Considerable efforts have been made over the last decades to improve the robustness of clustering algorithms against noise features and outliers, known to be important sources of error in clustering. Outliers dominate the sum-of-the-squares calculations and generate cluster overlap, thus leading to unreliable clustering results. They can be particularly detrimental in computational biology, e.g., when determining the number of clusters in gene expression data related to cancer or when inferring phylogenetic trees and networks. While the issue of feature weighting has been studied in detail, no clustering methods using object weighting have been proposed yet. Here we describe a new general data partitioning method that includes an object-weighting step to assign higher weights to outliers and objects that cause cluster overlap. Different object weighting schemes, based on the Silhouette cluster validity index, the median and two intercluster distances, are defined. We compare our novel technique to a number of popular and efficient clustering algorithms, such as K-means, X-means, DAPC and Prediction Strength. In the presence of outliers and cluster overlap, our method largely outperforms X-means, DAPC and Prediction Strength as well as the K-means algorithm based on feature weighting.",

    "abstract": "This work proposes an extension of neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) by introducing an additional set of ODE input parameters to NODEs. This extension allows NODEs to learn multiple dynamics specified by the input parameter instances. Our extension is inspired by the concept of parameterized ODEs, which are widely investigated in computational science and engineering contexts, where characteristics of the governing equations vary over the input parameters. We apply the proposed parameterized NODEs (PNODEs) for learning latent dynamics of complex dynamical processes that arise in computational physics, which is an essential component for enabling rapid numerical simulations for time-critical physics applications. For this, we propose an encoder\u2013decoder-type framework, which models latent dynamics as PNODEs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PNODEs on benchmark problems from computational physics.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Background and Context Computing is being integrated into a range of STEM disciplines. Still, computing remains inaccessible to many minoritized groups, especially girls and certain people of color. In this mixed methods study, we investigated racial and gendered patterns of equity and inequity in high school physics classrooms incorporating computational modeling, with an emphasis on group work. Objective The objectives of this study were: 1) to document equity patterns in student participation and how they vary based on group composition by race and gender; and 2) to understand how discourses of race and gender influence group interactions. Method We used the EQUIP web app (https://www.equip.ninja) to analyze quantitative patterns in student participation. We then identified video of three group sessions and analyzed how discourses of race and gender mediated classroom interactions. Findings Data show that racial hierarchies were prominent, with White students dominating group interaction and Black and Latinx students experiencing substantial marginalization. While there was evidence of gender equity in many groups \u2013 particularly those with greater proportions of girls \u2013 we show how computing and physics were still maintained as masculine spaces. Implications Teachers of computing should intentionally structure learning environments to attenuate the impact of White supremacy and patriarchy. More research is also needed on how power operates in computing education at the level of classroom interaction.",

Convolutional neural networks have proven to be highly advantageous for compressing data arising from systems demonstrating a slow-decaying Kolmogorov n-width. However, these networks are restricted to data on structured meshes. Unstructured meshes are often required for performing analyses of real systems with complex geometry. Our custom graph convolution operators based on the available differential operators for a given spatial discretization effectively extend the application space of deep convolutional autoencoders to systems with arbitrarily complex geometry that are typically discretized using unstructured meshes. We propose sets of convolution operators based on the spatial derivative operators for the underlying spatial discretization, making the method particularly well suited to data arising from the solution of partial differential equations. We demonstrate the method using examples from heat transfer and fluid mechanics and show better than an order of magnitude improvement in accuracy over linear methods.",

    "abstract": "Conventional supervised binary classification algorithms have been widely applied to address significant research questions using biological and biomedical data. This classification scheme requires two fully labeled classes of data (e.g. positive and negative samples) to train a classification model. However, in many bioinformatics applications, labeling data is laborious, and the negative samples might be potentially mislabeled due to the limited sensitivity of the experimental equipment. The positive unlabeled (PU) learning scheme was therefore proposed to enable the classifier to learn directly from limited positive samples and a large number of unlabeled samples (i.e. a mixture of positive or negative samples). To date, several PU learning algorithms have been developed to address various biological questions, such as sequence identification, functional site characterization and interaction prediction. In this paper, we revisit a collection of 29 state-of-the-art PU learning bioinformatic applications to address various biological questions. Various important aspects are extensively discussed, including PU learning methodology, biological application, classifier design and evaluation strategy. We also comment on the existing issues of PU learning and offer our perspectives for the future development of PU learning applications. We anticipate that our work serves as an instrumental guideline for a better understanding of the PU learning framework in bioinformatics and further developing next-generation PU learning frameworks for critical biological applications.",

    "abstract": "The microbiome, by virtue of its interactions with the host, is implicated in various host functions including its influence on nutrition and homeostasis. Many chronic diseases such as diabetes, cancer, inflammatory bowel diseases are characterized by a disruption of microbial communities in at least one biological niche/organ system. Various molecular mechanisms between microbial and host components such as proteins, RNAs, metabolites have recently been identified, thus filling many gaps in our understanding of how the microbiome modulates host processes. Concurrently, high-throughput technologies have enabled the profiling of heterogeneous datasets capturing community level changes in the microbiome as well as the host responses. However, due to limitations in parallel sampling and analytical procedures, big gaps still exist in terms of how the microbiome mechanistically influences host functions at a system and community level. In the past decade, computational biology and machine learning methodologies have been developed with the aim of filling the existing gaps. Due to the agnostic nature of the tools, they have been applied in diverse disease contexts to analyze and infer the interactions between the microbiome and host molecular components. Some of these approaches allow the identification and analysis of affected downstream host processes. Most of the tools statistically or mechanistically integrate different types of -omic and meta -omic datasets followed by functional/biological interpretation. In this review, we provide an overview of the landscape of computational approaches for investigating mechanistic interactions between individual microbes/microbiome and the host and the opportunities for basic and clinical research. These could include but are not limited to the development of activity- and mechanism-based biomarkers, uncovering mechanisms for therapeutic interventions and generating integrated signatures to stratify patients.",

    "abstract": "There is evidence that long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) is related to genetic stability. However, the complex biological functions of these lncRNAs are unclear. TCGA - KIRC lncRNAs expression matrix and somatic mutation information data were obtained from TCGA database. \u201cGSVA\u201d package was applied to evaluate the genomic related pathway in each samples. GO and KEGG analysis were performed to show the biological function of lncRNAs-mRNAs. \u201cSurvival\u201d package was applied to determine the prognostic significance of lncRNAs. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was applied to conduct lncRNA prognosis model. In the present study, we applied computational biology to identify genome-related long noncoding RNA and identified 26 novel genomic instability-associated lncRNAs in clear cell renal cell carcinoma. We identified a genome instability-derived six lncRNA-based gene signature that significantly divided clear renal cell samples into high- and low-risk groups. We validated it in test cohorts. To further elucidate the role of the six lncRNAs in the model\u2019s genome stability, we performed a gene set variation analysis (GSVA) on the matrix. We performed Pearson correlation analysis between the GSVA scores of genomic stability-related pathways and lncRNA. It was determined that LINC00460 and LINC01234 could be used as critical factors in this study. They may influence the genome stability of clear cell carcinoma by participating in mediating critical targets in the base excision repair pathway, the DNA replication pathway, homologous recombination, mismatch repair pathway, and the P53 signaling pathway. These data suggest that LINC00460 and LINC01234 are crucial for the stability of the clear cell renal cell carcinoma genome.",

    "abstract": "Transcription factors are important cellular components of the process of gene expression control. Transcription factor binding sites are locations where transcription factors specifically recognize DNA sequences, targeting gene-specific regions and recruiting transcription factors or chromatin regulators to fine-tune spatiotemporal gene regulation. As the common proteins, transcription factors play a meaningful role in life-related activities. In the face of the increase in the protein sequence, it is urgent how to predict the structure and function of the protein effectively. At present, protein-DNA-binding site prediction methods are based on traditional machine learning algorithms and deep learning algorithms. In the early stage, we usually used the development method based on traditional machine learning algorithm to predict protein-DNA-binding sites. In recent years, methods based on deep learning to predict protein-DNA-binding sites from sequence data have achieved remarkable success. Various statistical and machine learning methods used to predict the function of DNA-binding proteins have been proposed and continuously improved. Existing deep learning methods for predicting protein-DNA-binding sites can be roughly divided into three categories: convolutional neural network (CNN), recursive neural network (RNN) and hybrid neural network based on CNN-RNN. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the computational and experimental methods applied in the field of protein-DNA-binding site prediction today. This paper introduces the methods of traditional machine learning and deep learning in protein-DNA-binding site prediction from the aspects of data processing characteristics of existing learning frameworks and differences between basic learning model frameworks. Our existing methods are relatively simple compared with natural language processing, computational vision, computer graphics and other fields. Therefore, the summary of existing protein-DNA-binding site prediction methods will help researchers better understand this field.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer (BC) is a malignant tumor with high morbidity and mortality, which seriously threatens women\u2019s health worldwide. Pyroptosis is closely correlated with immune landscape and the tumorigenesis and development of various cancers. However, studies about pyroptosis and immune microenvironment in BC are limited. Therefore, our study aimed to investigate the potential prognostic value of pyroptosis-related genes (PRGs) and their relationship to immune microenvironment in BC. First, we identified 38 differentially expressed PRGs between BC and normal tissues. Further on, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression and computational biology techniques were applied to construct a four-gene signature based on PRGs and patients in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort were classified into high- and low-risk groups. Patients in the high-risk group showed significantly lower survival possibilities compared with the low-risk group, which was also verified in an external cohort. Furthermore, the risk model was characterized as an independent factor for predicting the overall survival (OS) of BC patients. What is more important, functional enrichment analyses demonstrated the robust correlation between risk score and immune infiltration, thereby we summarized genetic mutation variation of PRGs, evaluated the relationship between PRGs, different risk group and immune infiltration, tumor mutation burden (TMB), microsatellite instability (MSI), and immune checkpoint blockers (ICB), which indicated that the low-risk group was enriched in higher TMB, more abundant immune cells, and subsequently had a brighter prognosis. Except for that, the lower expression of PRGs such as GZMB, IL18, IRF1, and GZMA represented better survival, which verified the association between pyroptosis and immune landscape. In conclusion, we performed a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis and established a four-PRG signature consisting of GZMB, IL18, IRF1, and GZMA, which could robustly predict the prognosis of BC patients.",

    "abstract": "During the COVID-19 pandemic, mathematical modeling of disease transmission has become a cornerstone of key state decisions. To advance the state-of-the-art host viral modeling to handle future pandemics, many scientists working on related issues assembled to discuss the topics. These discussions exposed the reproducibility crisis that leads to inability to reuse and integrate models. This document summarizes these discussions, presents difficulties, and mentions existing efforts towards future solutions that will allow future model utility and integration. We argue that without addressing these challenges, scientists will have diminished ability to build, disseminate, and implement high-impact multi-scale modeling that is needed to understand the health crises we face.",

These developments have spurred the use of interpretable machine learning (IML) to unveil fundamental biological insights through data-driven knowledge discovery. However, in general, standards and guidelines for IML usage in computational biology have not been well-characterized, representing a major gap toward fully realizing the potential of IML. Here, we introduce a workflow on the best practices for using IML methods to perform knowledge discovery which covers verification strategies that bridge data, prediction model, and explanation. We outline a workflow incorporating these verification strategies to increase an IML method\u2019s accountability, reliability, and generalizability. We contextualize our proposed workflow in a series of widely applicable computational biology problems. Together, we provide an extensive workflow with important principles for the appropriate use of IML in computational biology, paving the way for a better mechanistic understanding of ML models and advancing the ability to discover novel biological phenomena.",

    "abstract": "Abstract MERS-CoV, a zoonotic virus, poses a serious threat to public health globally. Thus, it is imperative to develop an effective vaccination strategy for protection against MERS-CoV. Immunoinformatics and computational biology tools provide a faster and more cost-effective strategy to design potential vaccine candidates. In this work, the spike proteins from different strains of MERS-CoV were selected to predict HTL-epitopes that show affinity for T-helper MHC-class II HTL allelic determinant (HLA-DRB1:0101). The antigenicity and conservation of these epitopes among the selected spike protein variants in different MERS-CoV strains were analyzed. The analysis identified five epitopes with high antigenicity: QSIFYRLNGVGITQQ, DTIKYYSIIPHSIRS, PEPITSLNTKYVAPQ, INGRLTTLNAFVAQQ and GDMYVYSAGHATGTT. Then, a multi-epitope vaccine candidate was designed using linkers and adjuvant molecules. Finally, the vaccine construct was subjected to molecular docking with TLR5 (Toll-like receptor-5). The proposed vaccine construct had strong binding energy of \u221232.3\u2009kcal/mol when interacting with TLR5.Molecular dynamics simulation analysis showed that the complex of the vaccine construct and TLR5 is stable. Analysis using in silico immune simulation also showed that the prospective multi-epitope vaccine design had the potential to elicit a response within 70\u2009days, with the immune system producing cytokines and immunoglobulins. Finally, codon adaptation and in silico cloning analysis showed that the candidate vaccine could be expressed in the Escherichia coli K12 strain. Here we also designed support vaccine construct MEV-2 by using B-cell and CD8+ CTL epitopes to generate the complete immunogenic effect. This study opens new avenues for the extension of research on MERS vaccine development. Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma",

    "abstract": "The quantitative study of many physical problems ultimately boils down to solving various partial differential equations (PDEs). Wavelet analysis, known as the \u201cmathematical microscope\u201d, has been hailed for its excellent Multiresolution Analysis (MRA) capabilities and its basis functions that possess various desirable mathematical qualities such as orthogonality, compact support, low\u2010pass filtering, and interpolation. These properties make wavelets a powerful tool for efficiently solving these PDEs. Over the past 30 years, numerical methods such as wavelet Galerkin methods, wavelet collocation methods, wavelet finite element methods, and wavelet integral collocation methods have been proposed and successfully applied in the quantitative analysis of various physical problems. This article will start from the fundamental theory of wavelet MRA and provide a brief summary of the advantages and limitations of various numerical methods based on wavelet bases. The objective of this article is to assist researchers in choosing the appropriate numerical methodologies for their particular physical issues. Furthermore, it will explore prospective advancements in wavelet\u2010based techniques, offering valuable insights for researchers committed to enhancing wavelet numerical methods in the field of computational physics.",

One pathway forward is through creativity, a process crucial for learning and also connected to the act of using gen-AI. This poster demonstrates the results of a study designed to provide an in-depth view on how creativity intersects with gen-AI usage in a computational physics course. In the course, students learn about computing tools during group-based, open-ended computational physics activities. Students are often tasked with using gen-AI to explore and help make decisions.

    "title": "Survey on deep learning with class imbalance",
    "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to examine existing deep learning techniques for addressing class imbalanced data. Effective classification with imbalanced data is an important area of research, as high class imbalance is naturally inherent in many real-world applications, e.g., fraud detection and cancer detection. Moreover, highly imbalanced data poses added difficulty, as most learners will exhibit bias towards the majority class, and in extreme cases, may ignore the minority class altogether. Class imbalance has been studied thoroughly over the last two decades using traditional machine learning models, i.e. non-deep learning. Despite recent advances in deep learning, along with its increasing popularity, very little empirical work in the area of deep learning with class imbalance exists. Having achieved record-breaking performance results in several complex domains, investigating the use of deep neural networks for problems containing high levels of class imbalance is of great interest. Available studies regarding class imbalance and deep learning are surveyed in order to better understand the efficacy of deep learning when applied to class imbalanced data. This survey discusses the implementation details and experimental results for each study, and offers additional insight into their strengths and weaknesses. Several areas of focus include: data complexity, architectures tested, performance interpretation, ease of use, big data application, and generalization to other domains. We have found that research in this area is very limited, that most existing work focuses on computer vision tasks with convolutional neural networks, and that the effects of big data are rarely considered. Several traditional methods for class imbalance, e.g. data sampling and cost-sensitive learning, prove to be applicable in deep learning, while more advanced methods that exploit neural network feature learning abilities show promising results. The survey concludes with a discussion that highlights various gaps in deep learning from class imbalanced data for the purpose of guiding future research.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in diverse applications; however, its use in solving partial differential equations (PDEs) has emerged only recently. Here, we present an overview of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), which embed a PDE into the loss of the neural network using automatic differentiation. The PINN algorithm is simple, and it can be applied to different types of PDEs, including integro-differential equations, fractional PDEs, and stochastic PDEs. Moreover, from the implementation point of view, PINNs solve inverse problems as easily as forward problems. We propose a new residual-based adaptive refinement (RAR) method to improve the training efficiency of PINNs. For pedagogical reasons, we compare the PINN algorithm to a standard finite element method. We also present a Python library for PINNs, DeepXDE, which is designed to serve both as an education tool to be used in the classroom as well as a research tool for solving problems in computational science and engineering. Specifically, DeepXDE can solve forward problems given initial and boundary conditions, as well as inverse problems given some extra measurements. DeepXDE supports complex-geometry domains based on the technique of constructive solid geometry, and enables the user code to be compact, resembling closely the mathematical formulation. We introduce the usage of DeepXDE and its customizability, and we also demonstrate the capability of PINNs and the user-friendliness of DeepXDE for five different examples. More broadly, DeepXDE contributes to the more rapid development of the emerging Scientific Machine Learning field.",

    "abstract": "Since its renaissance, deep learning (DL) has been widely used in various medical imaging tasks and has achieved remarkable success in many medical imaging applications, thereby propelling us into the so-called artificial intelligence (AI) era. It is known that the success of AI is mostly attributed to the availability of big data with annotations for a single task and the advances in high-performance computing. However, medical imaging presents unique challenges that confront DL approaches. In this survey article, we first present traits of medical imaging, highlight both clinical needs and technical challenges in medical imaging, and describe how emerging trends in DL are addressing these issues. We cover the topics of network architecture, sparse and noisy labels, federating learning, interpretability, uncertainty quantification, and so on. Then, we present several case studies that are commonly found in clinical practice, including digital pathology and chest, brain, cardiovascular, and abdominal imaging. Rather than presenting an exhaustive literature survey, we instead describe some prominent research highlights related to these case study applications. We conclude with a discussion and presentation of promising future directions.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) systems for computer-aided diagnosis and image-based screening are being adopted worldwide by medical institutions. In such a context, generating fair and unbiased classifiers becomes of paramount importance. The research community of medical image computing is making great efforts in developing more accurate algorithms to assist medical doctors in the difficult task of disease diagnosis. However, little attention is paid to the way databases are collected and how this may influence the performance of AI systems. Our study sheds light on the importance of gender balance in medical imaging datasets used to train AI systems for computer-assisted diagnosis. We provide empirical evidence supported by a large-scale study, based on three deep neural network architectures and two well-known publicly available X-ray image datasets used to diagnose various thoracic diseases under different gender imbalance conditions. We found a consistent decrease in performance for underrepresented genders when a minimum balance is not fulfilled. This raises the alarm for national agencies in charge of regulating and approving computer-assisted diagnosis systems, which should include explicit gender balance and diversity recommendations. We also establish an open problem for the academic medical image computing community which needs to be addressed by novel algorithms endowed with robustness to gender imbalance.",

Herein, such recent advances in the bio\u2010inspired artificial vision and neuromorphic image processing devices, aimed at providing efficient image recognition, are reviewed. First, various imaging devices inspired by the structural and functional features of natural eyes are introduced. Second, artificial synapses and their operation principles are thoroughly discussed.

In this article, we focus on technology assistance for one of the most common and deadly diseases to exist, which is brain tumors. Every year, many people die due to brain tumors; based on \u201cbraintumor\u201d website estimation in the U.S., about 700,000 people have primary brain tumors, and about 85,000 people are added to this estimation every year. To solve this problem, artificial intelligence has come to the aid of medicine and humans. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most common method to diagnose brain tumors. Additionally, MRI is commonly used in medical imaging and image processing to diagnose dissimilarity in different parts of the body. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive review on the existing efforts for applying different types of deep learning methods on the MRI data and determined the existing challenges in the domain followed by potential future directions. One of the branches of deep learning that has been very successful in processing medical images is CNN. Therefore, in this survey, various architectures of CNN were reviewed with a focus on the processing of medical images, especially brain MRI images.",

    "abstract": "Multi-modal foundation models are typically trained on millions of pairs of natural images and text captions, frequently obtained through web-crawling approaches. Although such models depict excellent generative capabilities, they do not typically generalize well to specific domains such as medical images that have fundamentally shifted distributions compared to natural images. Building generative models for medical images that faithfully depict clinical context may help alleviate the paucity of healthcare datasets. Thus, in this study, we seek to research and expand the representational capabilities of large pretrained foundation models to medical concepts, specifically for leveraging the Stable Diffusion model to generate domain specific images found in medical imaging. We explore the sub-components of the Stable Diffusion pipeline (the variational autoencoder, the U-Net and the text-encoder) to fine-tune the model to generate medical images. We benchmark the efficacy of these efforts using quantitative image quality metrics and qualitative radiologist-driven evaluations that accurately represent the clinical content of conditional text prompts. Our best-performing model improves upon the stable diffusion baseline and can be conditioned to insert a realistic-looking abnormality on a synthetic radiology image, while maintaining a 95% accuracy on a classifier trained to detect the abnormality.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a comprehensive study of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and transfer learning in the context of medical imaging. Medical imaging plays a critical role in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases, and CNN-based models have demonstrated significant improvements in image analysis and classification tasks. Transfer learning, which involves reusing pre-trained CNN models, has also shown promise in addressing challenges related to small datasets and limited computational resources. This paper reviews the advantages of CNN and transfer learning in medical imaging, including improved accuracy, reduced time and resource requirements, and the ability to address class imbalances. It also discusses challenges, such as the need for large and diverse datasets, and the limited interpretability of deep learning models. What factors contribute to the success of these networks? How are they fashioned, exactly? What motivated them to build the structures that they did? Finally, the paper presents current and future research directions and opportunities, including the development of specialized architectures and the exploration of new modalities and applications for medical imaging using CNN and transfer learning techniques. Overall, the paper highlights the significant potential of CNN and transfer learning in the field of medical imaging, while also acknowledging the need for continued research and development to overcome existing challenges and limitations.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning has become a popular tool for medical image analysis, but the limited availability of training data remains a major challenge, particularly in the medical field where data acquisition can be costly and subject to privacy regulations. Data augmentation techniques offer a solution by artificially increasing the number of training samples, but these techniques often produce limited and unconvincing results. To address this issue, a growing number of studies have proposed the use of deep generative models to generate more realistic and diverse data that conform to the true distribution of the data. In this review, we focus on three types of deep generative models for medical image augmentation: variational autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, and diffusion models. We provide an overview of the current state of the art in each of these models and discuss their potential for use in different downstream tasks in medical imaging, including classification, segmentation, and cross-modal translation. We also evaluate the strengths and limitations of each model and suggest directions for future research in this field. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive review about the use of deep generative models for medical image augmentation and to highlight the potential of these models for improving the performance of deep learning algorithms in medical image analysis.",

    "abstract": "The use of AI systems in healthcare for the early screening of diseases is of great clinical importance. Deep learning has shown great promise in medical imaging, but the reliability and trustworthiness of AI systems limit their deployment in real clinical scenes, where patient safety is at stake. Uncertainty estimation plays a pivotal role in producing a confidence evaluation along with the prediction of the deep model. This is particularly important in medical imaging, where the uncertainty in the model's predictions can be used to identify areas of concern or to provide additional information to the clinician. In this paper, we review the various types of uncertainty in deep learning, including aleatoric uncertainty and epistemic uncertainty. We further discuss how they can be estimated in medical imaging. More importantly, we review recent advances in deep learning models that incorporate uncertainty estimation in medical imaging. Finally, we discuss the challenges and future directions in uncertainty estimation in deep learning for medical imaging. We hope this review will ignite further interest in the community and provide researchers with an up-to-date reference regarding applications of uncertainty estimation models in medical imaging.",

We mainly analyze the performance and efficiency of different network architectures built using KAN concepts along with conventional building blocks of convolutional and linear layers, enabling a comparative analysis with the conventional models. Our findings are aimed at contributing to understanding the potential of KANs in computer vision, highlighting both their strengths and areas for further research.

However, gauging absorption currently relies on labor-intensive and infrequent weight measurements, as outlined in ASTM C1585. To address this issue, we introduce a custom computer vision model trained on 6234 images, consisting of 4000 real and 2234 synthetic, that automatically detects the water level in prismatic samples absorbing water. This model provides accurate and frequent estimations of water penetration values every minute. After training the model on 1440 unique data points, including 15 paste mixtures with varying water-to-cement ratios from 0.4 to 0.8 and curing periods of 1 to 7 days, we can now predict initial and secondary sorptivities in real time with high confidence, achieving R\u00b2 > 0.9. Finally, we demonstrate its application on mortar and concrete systems, opening a pathway toward low-cost and automated durability assessment of construction materials.",

This limitation has increased interest in designing more interpretable deep models for NLP that reveal the \u2018reasoning\u2019 behind model outputs. But work in this direction has been conducted on different datasets and tasks with correspondingly unique aims and metrics; this makes it difficult to track progress.

This benchmark comprises multiple datasets and tasks for which human annotations of \u201crationales\u201d (supporting evidence) have been collected. We propose several metrics that aim to capture how well the rationales provided by models align with human rationales, and also how faithful these rationales are (i.e., the degree to which provided rationales influenced the corresponding predictions). Our hope is that releasing this benchmark facilitates progress on designing more interpretable NLP systems. The benchmark, code, and documentation are available at https://www.eraserbenchmark.com/",

    "title": "Dice Loss for Data-imbalanced NLP Tasks",
    "abstract": "Many NLP tasks such as tagging and machine reading comprehension are faced with the severe data imbalance issue: negative examples significantly outnumber positive examples, and the huge number of easy-negative examples overwhelms the training. The most commonly used cross entropy (CE) criteria is actually an accuracy-oriented objective, and thus creates a discrepancy between training and test: at training time, each training instance contributes equally to the objective function, while at test time F1 score concerns more about positive examples. In this paper, we propose to use dice loss in replacement of the standard cross-entropy objective for data-imbalanced NLP tasks. Dice loss is based on the S\u00f8rensen--Dice coefficient or Tversky index , which attaches similar importance to false positives and false negatives, and is more immune to the data-imbalance issue. To further alleviate the dominating influence from easy-negative examples in training, we propose to associate training examples with dynamically adjusted weights to deemphasize easy-negative examples. Theoretical analysis shows that this strategy narrows down the gap between the F1 score in evaluation and the dice loss in training. With the proposed training objective, we observe significant performance boost on a wide range of data imbalanced NLP tasks. Notably, we are able to achieve SOTA results on CTB5, CTB6 and UD1.4 for the part of speech tagging task; SOTA results on CoNLL03, OntoNotes5.0, MSRA and OntoNotes4.0 for the named entity recognition task; along with competitive results on the tasks of machine reading comprehension and paraphrase identification.",

Currently, most NLP models treat numbers in text in the same way as other tokens\u2014they embed them as distributed vectors. Is this enough to capture numeracy? We begin by investigating the numerical reasoning capabilities of a state-of-the-art question answering model on the DROP dataset. We find this model excels on questions that require numerical reasoning, i.e., it already captures numeracy. To understand how this capability emerges, we probe token embedding methods (e.g., BERT, GloVe) on synthetic list maximum, number decoding, and addition tasks. A surprising degree of numeracy is naturally present in standard embeddings. For example, GloVe and word2vec accurately encode magnitude for numbers up to 1,000. Furthermore, character-level embeddings are even more precise\u2014ELMo captures numeracy the best for all pre-trained methods\u2014but BERT, which uses sub-word units, is less exact.",

We consider this as a new type of adversarial attack in NLP, a setting to which humans are very robust, as our experiments with both simple and more difficult visual perturbations demonstrate. We investigate the impact of visual adversarial attacks on current NLP systems on character-, word-, and sentence-level tasks, showing that both neural and non-neural models are, in contrast to humans, extremely sensitive to such attacks, suffering performance decreases of up to 82%. We then explore three shielding methods\u2014visual character embeddings, adversarial training, and rule-based recovery\u2014which substantially improve the robustness of the models. However, the shielding methods still fall behind performances achieved in non-attack scenarios, which demonstrates the difficulty of dealing with visual attacks.",

But what is interpretability, and what constitutes a high-quality interpretation? In this opinion piece we reflect on the current state of interpretability evaluation research. We call for more clearly differentiating between different desired criteria an interpretation should satisfy, and focus on the faithfulness criteria. We survey the literature with respect to faithfulness evaluation, and arrange the current approaches around three assumptions, providing an explicit form to how faithfulness is \u201cdefined\u201d by the community. We provide concrete guidelines on how evaluation of interpretation methods should and should not be conducted.

Next, we demonstrate that the neural embeddings that are the critical first step in most NLP pipelines similarly contain undesirable biases towards mentions of disability. We end by highlighting topical biases in the discourse about disability which may contribute to the observed model biases; for instance, gun violence, homelessness, and drug addiction are over-represented in texts discussing mental illness.",

    "abstract": "Internet forums and public social media, such as online healthcare forums, provide a convenient channel for users (people/patients) concerned about health issues to discuss and share information with each other. In late December 2019, an outbreak of a novel coronavirus (infection from which results in the disease named COVID-19) was reported, and, due to the rapid spread of the virus in other parts of the world, the World Health Organization declared a state of emergency. In this paper, we used automated extraction of COVID-19\u2013related discussions from social media and a natural language process (NLP) method based on topic modeling to uncover various issues related to COVID-19 from public opinions. Moreover, we also investigate how to use LSTM recurrent neural network for sentiment classification of COVID-19 comments. Our findings shed light on the importance of using public opinions and suitable computational techniques to understand issues surrounding COVID-19 and to guide related decision-making.",

    "abstract": "We investigated the effect of different training scenarios on predicting the (retro)synthesis of chemical compounds using text-like representation of chemical reactions (SMILES) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) neural network Transformer architecture. We showed that data augmentation, which is a powerful method used in image processing, eliminated the effect of data memorization by neural networks and improved their performance for prediction of new sequences. This effect was observed when augmentation was used simultaneously for input and the target data simultaneously. The top-5 accuracy was 84.8% for the prediction of the largest fragment (thus identifying principal transformation for classical retro-synthesis) for the USPTO-50k test dataset, and was achieved by a combination of SMILES augmentation and a beam search algorithm. The same approach provided significantly better results for the prediction of direct reactions from the single-step USPTO-MIT test set. Our model achieved 90.6% top-1 and 96.1% top-5 accuracy for its challenging mixed set and 97% top-5 accuracy for the USPTO-MIT separated set. It also significantly improved results for USPTO-full set single-step retrosynthesis for both top-1 and top-10 accuracies. The appearance frequency of the most abundantly generated SMILES was well correlated with the prediction outcome and can be used as a measure of the quality of reaction prediction. Development of algorithms to predict reactant and reagents given a target molecule is key to accelerate retrosynthesis approaches. Here the authors demonstrate that applying augmentation techniques to the SMILE representation of target data significantly improves the quality of the reaction predictions.",

    "abstract": "Transformers are ubiquitous in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, but they are difficult to be deployed on hardware due to the intensive computation. To enable low-latency inference on resource-constrained hardware platforms, we propose to design Hardware-Aware Transformers (HAT) with neural architecture search. We first construct a large design space with arbitrary encoder-decoder attention and heterogeneous layers. Then we train a SuperTransformer that covers all candidates in the design space, and efficiently produces many SubTransformers with weight sharing. Finally, we perform an evolutionary search with a hardware latency constraint to find a specialized SubTransformer dedicated to run fast on the target hardware. Extensive experiments on four machine translation tasks demonstrate that HAT can discover efficient models for different hardware (CPU, GPU, IoT device). When running WMT\u201914 translation task on Raspberry Pi-4, HAT can achieve 3\u00d7 speedup, 3.7\u00d7 smaller size over baseline Transformer; 2.7\u00d7 speedup, 3.6\u00d7 smaller size over Evolved Transformer with 12,041\u00d7 less search cost and no performance loss.

    "abstract": "There have been various types of pretraining architectures including autoencoding models (e.g., BERT), autoregressive models (e.g., GPT), and encoder-decoder models (e.g., T5). However, none of the pretraining frameworks performs the best for all tasks of three main categories including natural language understanding (NLU), unconditional generation, and conditional generation. We propose a General Language Model (GLM) based on autoregressive blank infilling to address this challenge. GLM improves blank filling pretraining by adding 2D positional encodings and allowing an arbitrary order to predict spans, which results in performance gains over BERT and T5 on NLU tasks. Meanwhile, GLM can be pretrained for different types of tasks by varying the number and lengths of blanks. On a wide range of tasks across NLU, conditional and unconditional generation, GLM outperforms BERT, T5, and GPT given the same model sizes and data, and achieves the best performance from a single pretrained model with 1.25\u00d7 parameters of BERT Large , demonstrating its generalizability to different downstream tasks.",

    "abstract": "With recent progress in joint modeling of visual and textual representations, Vision-Language Pretraining (VLP) has achieved impressive performance on many multimodal downstream tasks. However, the requirement for expensive annotations including clean image captions and regional labels limits the scalability of existing approaches, and complicates the pretraining procedure with the introduction of multiple dataset-specific objectives. In this work, we relax these constraints and present a minimalist pretraining framework, named Simple Visual Language Model (SimVLM). Unlike prior work, SimVLM reduces the training complexity by exploiting large-scale weak supervision, and is trained end-to-end with a single prefix language modeling objective. Without utilizing extra data or task-specific customization, the resulting model significantly outperforms previous pretraining methods and achieves new state-of-the-art results on a wide range of discriminative and generative vision-language benchmarks, including VQA (+3.74% vqa-score), NLVR2 (+1.17% accuracy), SNLI-VE (+1.37% accuracy) and image captioning tasks (+10.1% average CIDEr score). Furthermore, we demonstrate that SimVLM acquires strong generalization and transfer ability, enabling zero-shot behavior including open-ended visual question answering and cross-modality transfer.",

    "abstract": "Large language models have led to state-of-the-art accuracies across several tasks. However, training these models efficiently is challenging because: a) GPU memory capacity is limited, making it impossible to fit large models on even a multi-GPU server, and b) the number of compute operations required can result in unrealistically long training times. Consequently, new methods of model parallelism such as tensor and pipeline parallelism have been proposed. Unfortunately, naive usage of these methods leads to scaling issues at thousands of GPUs. In this paper, we show how tensor, pipeline, and data parallelism can be composed to scale to thousands of GPUs. We propose a novel interleaved pipelining schedule that can improve throughput by 10+% with memory footprint comparable to existing approaches. Our approach allows us to perform training iterations on a model with 1 trillion parameters at 502 petaFLOP/s on 3072 GPUs (per-GPU throughput of 52% of theoretical peak).",

    "abstract": "Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive potential on simple tasks, their breadth of scope, lack of transparency, and insufficient controllability can make them less effective when assisting humans on more complex tasks. In response, we introduce the concept of Chaining LLM steps together, where the output of one step becomes the input for the next, thus aggregating the gains per step. We first define a set of LLM primitive operations useful for Chain construction, then present an interactive system where users can modify these Chains, along with their intermediate results, in a modular way. In a 20-person user study, we found that Chaining not only improved the quality of task outcomes, but also significantly enhanced system transparency, controllability, and sense of collaboration. Additionally, we saw that users developed new ways of interacting with LLMs through Chains: they leveraged sub-tasks to calibrate model expectations, compared and contrasted alternative strategies by observing parallel downstream effects, and debugged unexpected model outputs by \u201cunit-testing\u201d sub-components of a Chain. In two case studies, we further explore how LLM Chains may be used in future applications.",

    "abstract": "Recent research demonstrates the effectiveness of using fine-tuned language models (LM) for dense retrieval. However, dense retrievers are hard to train, typically requiring heavily engineered fine-tuning pipelines to realize their full potential. In this paper, we identify and address two underlying problems of dense retrievers: i) fragility to training data noise and ii) requiring large batches to robustly learn the embedding space. We use the recently proposed Condenser pre-training architecture, which learns to condense information into the dense vector through LM pre-training. On top of it, we propose coCondenser, which adds an unsupervised corpus-level contrastive loss to warm up the passage embedding space. Experiments on MS-MARCO, Natural Question, and Trivia QA datasets show that coCondenser removes the need for heavy data engineering such as augmentation, synthesis, or filtering, and the need for large batch training. It shows comparable performance to RocketQA, a state-of-the-art, heavily engineered system, using simple small batch fine-tuning.",

This large and diverse collection of tasks enables rigorous benchmarking of cross-task generalization under instructions\u2014training models to follow instructions on a subset of tasks and evaluating them on the remaining unseen ones.Furthermore, we build Tk-Instruct, a transformer model trained to follow a variety of in-context instructions (plain language task definitions or k-shot examples). Our experiments show that Tk-Instruct outperforms existing instruction-following models such as InstructGPT by over 9% on our benchmark despite being an order of magnitude smaller. We further analyze generalization as a function of various scaling parameters, such as the number of observed tasks, the number of instances per task, and model sizes. We hope our dataset and model facilitate future progress towards more general-purpose NLP models.",

Existing work has combined these in simple\"retrieve-then-read\"pipelines in which the RM retrieves passages that are inserted into the LM prompt. To begin to fully realize the potential of frozen LMs and RMs, we propose Demonstrate-Search-Predict (DSP), a framework that relies on passing natural language texts in sophisticated pipelines between an LM and an RM. DSP can express high-level programs that bootstrap pipeline-aware demonstrations, search for relevant passages, and generate grounded predictions, systematically breaking down problems into small transformations that the LM and RM can handle more reliably. We have written novel DSP programs for answering questions in open-domain, multi-hop, and conversational settings, establishing in early evaluations new state-of-the-art in-context learning results and delivering 37-120%, 8-39%, and 80-290% relative gains against the vanilla LM (GPT-3.5), a standard retrieve-then-read pipeline, and a contemporaneous self-ask pipeline, respectively.

This has given rise to numerous efforts towards model explainability in recent years. One desideratum of model explanation is faithfulness, that is, an explanation should accurately represent the reasoning process behind the model\u2019s prediction. In this survey, we review over 110 model explanation methods in NLP through the lens of faithfulness. We first discuss the definition and evaluation of faithfulness, as well as its significance for explainability. We then introduce recent advances in faithful explanation, grouping existing approaches into five categories: similarity-based methods, analysis of model-internal structures, backpropagation-based methods, counterfactual intervention, and self-explanatory models. For each category, we synthesize its representative studies, strengths, and weaknesses. Finally, we summarize their common virtues and remaining challenges, and reflect on future work directions towards faithful explainability in NLP.",

    "abstract": "Significance Many fields\u2014including psychology, sociology, communications, political science, and computer science\u2014use computational methods to analyze text data. However, existing text analysis methods have a number of shortcomings. Dictionary methods, while easy to use, are often not very accurate when compared to recent methods. Machine learning models, while more accurate, can be difficult to train and use. We demonstrate that the large-language model GPT is capable of accurately detecting various psychological constructs (as judged by manual annotators) in text across 12 languages, using simple prompts and no additional training data. GPT thus overcomes the limitations present in existing methods. GPT is also effective in several lesser-spoken languages, which could facilitate text analysis research from understudied contexts.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we leverage LLM to enhance the semantic analysis and develop similarity metrics for texts, addressing the limitations of traditional unsupervised NLP metrics like ROUGE and BLEU. We develop a framework where LLMs such as GPT-4 are employed for zero-shot text identification and label generation for radiology reports, where the labels are then used as measurements for text similarity. By testing the proposed framework on the MIMIC data, we find that GPT-4 generated labels can significantly improve the semantic similarity assessment, with scores more closely aligned with clinical ground truth than traditional NLP metrics. Our work demonstrates the possibility of conducting semantic analysis of the text data using semi-quantitative reasoning results by the LLMs for highly specialized domains. While the framework is implemented for radiology report similarity analysis, its concept can be extended to other specialized domains as well.",

    "abstract": "Flexible neuromorphic electronics that emulate biological neuronal systems constitute a promising candidate for next\u2010generation wearable computing, soft robotics, and neuroprosthetics. For realization, with the achievement of simple synaptic behaviors in a single device, the construction of artificial synapses with various functions of sensing and responding and integrated systems to mimic complicated computing, sensing, and responding in biological systems is a prerequisite. Artificial synapses that have learning ability can perceive and react to events in the real world; these abilities expand the neuromorphic applications toward health monitoring and cybernetic devices in the future Internet of Things. To demonstrate the flexible neuromorphic systems successfully, it is essential to develop artificial synapses and nerves replicating the functionalities of the biological counterparts and satisfying the requirements for constructing the elements and the integrated systems such as flexibility, low power consumption, high\u2010density integration, and biocompatibility. Here, the progress of flexible neuromorphic electronics is addressed, from basic backgrounds including synaptic characteristics, device structures, and mechanisms of artificial synapses and nerves, to applications for computing, soft robotics, and neuroprosthetics. Finally, future research directions toward wearable artificial neuromorphic systems are suggested for this emerging area.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Currently, a large number of industrial robots have been deployed to replace or assist humans to perform various repetitive and dangerous manufacturing tasks. However, based on current technological capabilities, such robotics field is rapidly evolving so that humans are not only sharing the same workspace with robots, but also are using robots as useful assistants. Consequently, due to this new type of emerging robotic systems, industrial collaborative robots or cobots, human and robot co-workers have been able to work side-by-side as collaborators to accomplish tasks in industrial environments. Therefore, new human\u2013robot interaction systems have been developed for such systems to be able to utilize the capabilities of both humans and robots. Accordingly, this article presents a literature review of major recent works on human\u2013robot interactions in industrial collaborative robots, conducted during the last decade (between 2008 and 2017). Additionally, the article proposes a tentative classification of the content of these works into several categories and sub-categories. Finally, this paper addresses some challenges of industrial collaborative robotics and explores future research issues. GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT",

    "title": "The current state and future outlook of rescue robotics",
    "abstract": "Robotic technologies, whether they are remotely operated vehicles, autonomous agents, assistive devices, or novel control interfaces, offer many promising capabilities for deployment in real\u2010world environments. Postdisaster scenarios are a particularly relevant target for applying such technologies, due to the challenging conditions faced by rescue workers and the possibility to increase their efficacy while decreasing the risks they face. However, field\u2010deployable technologies for rescue work have requirements for robustness, speed, versatility, and ease of use that may not be matched by the state of the art in robotics research. This paper aims to survey the current state of the art in ground and aerial robots, marine and amphibious systems, and human\u2013robot control interfaces and assess the readiness of these technologies with respect to the needs of first responders and disaster recovery efforts. We have gathered expert opinions from emergency response stakeholders and researchers who conduct field deployments with them to understand these needs, and we present this assessment as a way to guide future research toward technologies that will make an impact in real\u2010world disaster response and recovery.",

    "abstract": "This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of research on robotics in travel, tourism and hospitality, and to identify research gaps and directions for future research.,This paper analyzes 131 publications published during 1993-2019, identified via Scopus, Web of Science, ResearchGate, Academia.edu and Google Scholar. It offers quantitative analysis of frequencies and cross-tables and qualitative thematic analysis of the publications within each of seven identified domains.,The paper identifies \u201cRobot,\u201d \u201cHuman,\u201d \u201cRobot manufacturer,\u201d \u201cTravel/tourism/hospitality company,\u201d \u201cServicescape,\u201d \u201cExternal environment\u201d and \u201cEducation, training and research\u201d as the research domains. Most research studies are dedicated to robots in restaurants, airports, hotels and bars. Papers tend to apply engineering methods, but experiments and surveys grow in popularity. Asia-Pacific countries account for much of the empirical research.,The analysis was limited to publications indexed in four databases and one search engine. Only publications in English were considered. Growing opportunities for those who are anxious to publish in the field are identified. Importantly, emerging research is branching out from the engineering of robots to the possibilities for human/robot interactions and their use for service providers, opening up new avenues of research for tourism and hospitality scholars.,The paper identified a myriad of application areas for robots across various tourism and hospitality sectors. Service providers must critically think about how robots affect the servicescape and how it needs to be adjusted or re-imagined to ensure that robots and employees can augment the service experiences (co-)created within it.,This is the first study to systematically analyze research publications on robotics in travel, tourism and hospitality.,\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u8bba\u4e86\u5728\u65c5\u6e38\u9152\u5e97\u4e1a\u4e2d\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6280\u672f\u7684\u7814\u7a76, \u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u6587\u732e\u7f3a\u53e3\u548c\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002,\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u57281993\u5e74\u81f32019\u5e74\u53d1\u5e03\u5728Scopus\u3001Web of Science\u3001ResearchGate\u3001Academia.edu\u3001\u548cGoogle Scholar\u7684131\u7bc7\u6587\u732e\u3002\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u5bf9\u6587\u732e\u505a\u4e86\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790, \u5305\u62ec\u9891\u7387\u5206\u6790\u3001\u4ea4\u53c9\u8868\u3001\u5b9a\u6027\u6587\u672c\u5206\u6790\u3001\u5728\u4e03\u5927\u786e\u7acb\u7684\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6587\u732e\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002,\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u786e\u7acb\u4e86\u4e03\u4e2a\u7814\u7a76\u9886\u57df\uff1a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u3001\u4eba\u7c7b\u3001\u673a\u5668\u751f\u4ea7\u8005\u3001\u65c5\u6e38\u9152\u5e97\u4f01\u4e1a\u3001Servicescape\u3001\u5916\u90e8\u73af\u5883\u3001\u548c\u6559\u80b2\u57f9\u8bad\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u5927\u591a\u6570\u6587\u732e\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u5bf9\u996d\u5e97\u3001\u673a\u573a\u3001\u9152\u5e97\u3001\u548c\u9152\u5427\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u6587\u732e\u5f80\u5f80\u91c7\u7528\u5de5\u7a0b\u624b\u6bb5\u8fdb\u884c\u7814\u7a76, \u4f46\u662f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u95ee\u5377\u65b9\u5f0f\u6b63\u5728\u5448\u589e\u957f\u8d8b\u52bf\u3002\u4e9a\u592a\u56fd\u5bb6\u5360\u636e\u5927\u591a\u6570\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u4f5c\u54c1\u3002,\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u6837\u672c\u5e93\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u56db\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u641c\u7d22\u5f15\u64ce\u3002\u53ea\u6709\u82f1\u6587\u6587\u732e\u88ab\u91c7\u6837\u3002\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u4e3a\u5bf9\u76f8\u5173\u9886\u57df\u611f\u5174\u8da3\u7684\u5b66\u8005\u6307\u51fa\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u662f, \u672c\u8bba\u6587\u53d1\u73b0\u7528\u5de5\u7a0b\u89d2\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u6587\u732e\u6709\u4e86\u5206\u652f, \u6709\u4e00\u5c0f\u90e8\u5206\u6587\u732e\u5f00\u59cb\u7740\u624b\u7814\u7a76\u4eba/\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u5176\u5728\u670d\u52a1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u7814\u7a76, \u8fd9\u5bf9\u65c5\u6e38\u9152\u5e97\u5b66\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u7814\u7a76\u89c6\u89d2\u3002,\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u6709\u5173\u65c5\u6e38\u9152\u5e97\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u670d\u52a1\u5546\u5fc5\u987b\u91cd\u89c6\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cdServicescape\u4ee5\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u5ba1\u89c6\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0e\u4eba\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92, \u786e\u4fdd\u5176\u4e0e\u5458\u5de5\u52a0\u5f3a\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u4f53\u9a8c\uff08\u4ef7\u503c\u5171\u521b\uff09\u3002,\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u662f\u9996\u7bc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u8bba\u65c5\u6e38\u9152\u5e97\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7814\u7a76\u6587\u732e\u7684\u6587\u7ae0\u3002,\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\uff1a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u3001\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7ecf\u6d4e\u3001\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4f7f\u7528\u3001Servicescape\u3001rService\u3001\u4eba-\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4ea4\u4e92\u3001\u7814\u7a76\u8bae\u7a0b",

    "abstract": "Learning from visual observations is a fundamental yet challenging problem in Reinforcement Learning (RL). Although algorithmic advances combined with convolutional neural networks have proved to be a recipe for success, current methods are still lacking on two fronts: (a) data-efficiency of learning and (b) generalization to new environments. To this end, we present Reinforcement Learning with Augmented Data (RAD), a simple plug-and-play module that can enhance most RL algorithms. We perform the first extensive study of general data augmentations for RL on both pixel-based and state-based inputs, and introduce two new data augmentations - random translate and random amplitude scale. We show that augmentations such as random translate, crop, color jitter, patch cutout, random convolutions, and amplitude scale can enable simple RL algorithms to outperform complex state-of-the-art methods across common benchmarks. RAD sets a new state-of-the-art in terms of data-efficiency and final performance on the DeepMind Control Suite benchmark for pixel-based control as well as OpenAI Gym benchmark for state-based control. We further demonstrate that RAD significantly improves test-time generalization over existing methods on several OpenAI ProcGen benchmarks. Our RAD module and training code are available at this https URL.",

    "title": "Accelerating Online Reinforcement Learning with Offline Datasets",
    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning provides an appealing formalism for learning control policies from experience. However, the classic active formulation of reinforcement learning necessitates a lengthy active exploration process for each behavior, making it difficult to apply in real-world settings. If we can instead allow reinforcement learning to effectively use previously collected data to aid the online learning process, where the data could be expert demonstrations or more generally any prior experience, we could make reinforcement learning a substantially more practical tool. While a number of recent methods have sought to learn offline from previously collected data, it remains exceptionally difficult to train a policy with offline data and improve it further with online reinforcement learning. In this paper we systematically analyze why this problem is so challenging, and propose a novel algorithm that combines sample-efficient dynamic programming with maximum likelihood policy updates, providing a simple and effective framework that is able to leverage large amounts of offline data and then quickly perform online fine-tuning of reinforcement learning policies. We show that our method enables rapid learning of skills with a combination of prior demonstration data and online experience across a suite of difficult dexterous manipulation and benchmark tasks.",

    "abstract": "In neural combinatorial optimization (CO), reinforcement learning (RL) can turn a deep neural net into a fast, powerful heuristic solver of NP-hard problems. This approach has a great potential in practical applications because it allows near-optimal solutions to be found without expert guides armed with substantial domain knowledge. We introduce Policy Optimization with Multiple Optima (POMO), an end-to-end approach for building such a heuristic solver. POMO is applicable to a wide range of CO problems. It is designed to exploit the symmetries in the representation of a CO solution. POMO uses a modified REINFORCE algorithm that forces diverse rollouts towards all optimal solutions. Empirically, the low-variance baseline of POMO makes RL training fast and stable, and it is more resistant to local minima compared to previous approaches. We also introduce a new augmentation-based inference method, which accompanies POMO nicely. We demonstrate the effectiveness of POMO by solving three popular NP-hard problems, namely, traveling salesman (TSP), capacitated vehicle routing (CVRP), and 0-1 knapsack (KP). For all three, our solver based on POMO shows a significant improvement in performance over all recent learned heuristics. In particular, we achieve the optimality gap of 0.14% with TSP100 while reducing inference time by more than an order of magnitude.",

    "abstract": "Safety is an essential component for deploying reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms in real-world scenarios, and is critical during the learning process itself. A natural first approach toward safe RL is to manually specify constraints on the policy's behavior. However, just as learning has enabled progress in large-scale development of AI systems, learning safety specifications may also be necessary to ensure safety in messy open-world environments where manual safety specifications cannot scale. Akin to how humans learn incrementally starting in child-safe environments, we propose to learn how to be safe in one set of tasks and environments, and then use that learned intuition to constrain future behaviors when learning new, modified tasks. We empirically study this form of safety-constrained transfer learning in three challenging domains: simulated navigation, quadruped locomotion, and dexterous in-hand manipulation. In comparison to standard deep RL techniques and prior approaches to safe RL, we find that our method enables the learning of new tasks and in new environments with both substantially fewer safety incidents, such as falling or dropping an object, and faster, more stable learning. This suggests a path forward not only for safer RL systems, but also for more effective RL systems.",

    "title": "Deep Reinforcement Learning at the Edge of the Statistical Precipice",
    "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are predominantly evaluated by comparing their relative performance on a large suite of tasks. Most published results on deep RL benchmarks compare point estimates of aggregate performance such as mean and median scores across tasks, ignoring the statistical uncertainty implied by the use of a finite number of training runs. Beginning with the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE), the shift towards computationally-demanding benchmarks has led to the practice of evaluating only a small number of runs per task, exacerbating the statistical uncertainty in point estimates. In this paper, we argue that reliable evaluation in the few run deep RL regime cannot ignore the uncertainty in results without running the risk of slowing down progress in the field. We illustrate this point using a case study on the Atari 100k benchmark, where we find substantial discrepancies between conclusions drawn from point estimates alone versus a more thorough statistical analysis. With the aim of increasing the field's confidence in reported results with a handful of runs, we advocate for reporting interval estimates of aggregate performance and propose performance profiles to account for the variability in results, as well as present more robust and efficient aggregate metrics, such as interquartile mean scores, to achieve small uncertainty in results. Using such statistical tools, we scrutinize performance evaluations of existing algorithms on other widely used RL benchmarks including the ALE, Procgen, and the DeepMind Control Suite, again revealing discrepancies in prior comparisons. Our findings call for a change in how we evaluate performance in deep RL, for which we present a more rigorous evaluation methodology, accompanied with an open-source library rliable, to prevent unreliable results from stagnating the field.",

    "title": "Bridging Offline Reinforcement Learning and Imitation Learning: A Tale of Pessimism",
    "abstract": "Offline reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms seek to learn an optimal policy from a fixed dataset without active data collection. Based on the composition of the offline dataset, two main methods are used: imitation learning which is suitable for expert datasets, and vanilla offline RL which often requires uniform coverage datasets. From a practical standpoint, datasets often deviate from these two extremes and the exact data composition is usually unknown. To bridge this gap, we present a new offline RL framework, called single-policy concentrability, that smoothly interpolates between the two extremes of data composition, hence unifying imitation learning and vanilla offline RL. Under this new framework, we ask: can one develop an algorithm that achieves a minimax optimal rate adaptive to unknown data composition? To address this question, we consider a lower confidence bound (LCB) algorithm developed based on pessimism in the face of uncertainty in offline RL. We study finite-sample properties of LCB as well as information-theoretic limits in multi-armed bandits, contextual bandits, and Markov decision processes (MDPs). Our analysis reveals surprising facts about optimality rates. In particular, in both contextual bandits and RL, LCB achieves a fast convergence rate for nearly-expert datasets, analogous to the one achieved by imitation learning, contrary to the slow rate achieved in offline RL. In contextual bandits, we prove that LCB is adaptively optimal for the entire data composition range, achieving a smooth transition from imitation learning to offline RL. We further show that LCB is almost adaptively optimal in MDPs.",

    "abstract": "Conveying complex objectives to reinforcement learning (RL) agents can often be difficult, involving meticulous design of reward functions that are sufficiently informative yet easy enough to provide. Human-in-the-loop RL methods allow practitioners to instead interactively teach agents through tailored feedback; however, such approaches have been challenging to scale since human feedback is very expensive. In this work, we aim to make this process more sample- and feedback-efficient. We present an off-policy, interactive RL algorithm that capitalizes on the strengths of both feedback and off-policy learning. Specifically, we learn a reward model by actively querying a teacher's preferences between two clips of behavior and use it to train an agent. To enable off-policy learning, we relabel all the agent's past experience when its reward model changes. We additionally show that pre-training our agents with unsupervised exploration substantially increases the mileage of its queries. We demonstrate that our approach is capable of learning tasks of higher complexity than previously considered by human-in-the-loop methods, including a variety of locomotion and robotic manipulation skills. We also show that our method is able to utilize real-time human feedback to effectively prevent reward exploitation and learn new behaviors that are difficult to specify with standard reward functions.",

    "abstract": "Offline reinforcement learning (offline RL), which aims to find an optimal policy from a previously collected static dataset, bears algorithmic difficulties due to function approximation errors from out-of-distribution (OOD) data points. To this end, offline RL algorithms adopt either a constraint or a penalty term that explicitly guides the policy to stay close to the given dataset. However, prior methods typically require accurate estimation of the behavior policy or sampling from OOD data points, which themselves can be a non-trivial problem. Moreover, these methods under-utilize the generalization ability of deep neural networks and often fall into suboptimal solutions too close to the given dataset. In this work, we propose an uncertainty-based offline RL method that takes into account the confidence of the Q-value prediction and does not require any estimation or sampling of the data distribution. We show that the clipped Q-learning, a technique widely used in online RL, can be leveraged to successfully penalize OOD data points with high prediction uncertainties. Surprisingly, we find that it is possible to substantially outperform existing offline RL methods on various tasks by simply increasing the number of Q-networks along with the clipped Q-learning. Based on this observation, we propose an ensemble-diversified actor-critic algorithm that reduces the number of required ensemble networks down to a tenth compared to the naive ensemble while achieving state-of-the-art performance on most of the D4RL benchmarks considered.",

Our method employs a combination of value conservatism alongside an implicit dataset support constraint in learning value functions, which are then used to guide language model generations towards maximizing user-specified utility functions. In addition to empirically validating ILQL, we present a detailed empirical analysis of situations where offline RL can be useful in natural language generation settings, demonstrating how it can be a more effective utility optimizer than prior approaches for end-to-end dialogue, and how it can effectively optimize high variance reward functions based on subjective judgement, such as whether to label a comment as toxic or not.",

We demonstrate these advantages by adapting the classical Q learning/iteration algorithm to the hybrid setting, which we call Hybrid Q-Learning or Hy-Q. In our theoretical results, we prove that the algorithm is both computationally and statistically efficient whenever the offline dataset supports a high-quality policy and the environment has bounded bilinear rank.

    "abstract": "While reinforcement learning (RL) has become a more popular approach for robotics, designing sufficiently informative reward functions for complex tasks has proven to be extremely difficult due their inability to capture human intent and policy exploitation. Preference based RL algorithms seek to overcome these challenges by directly learning reward functions from human feedback. Unfortunately, prior work either requires an unreasonable number of queries implausible for any human to answer or overly restricts the class of reward functions to guarantee the elicitation of the most informative queries, resulting in models that are insufficiently expressive for realistic robotics tasks. Contrary to most works that focus on query selection to \\emph{minimize} the amount of data required for learning reward functions, we take an opposite approach: \\emph{expanding} the pool of available data by viewing human-in-the-loop RL through the more flexible lens of multi-task learning. Motivated by the success of meta-learning, we pre-train preference models on prior task data and quickly adapt them for new tasks using only a handful of queries. Empirically, we reduce the amount of online feedback needed to train manipulation policies in Meta-World by 20$\\times$, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a real Franka Panda Robot. Moreover, this reduction in query-complexity allows us to train robot policies from actual human users.

At the same time, artificial intelligence (AI) has dramatically changed people\u2019s lives. Especially for vehicular task offloading applications, AI achieves state-of-the-art performance in various vehicular environments. Motivated by the outstanding performance of integrating reinforcement learning (RL)/deep RL (DRL) to the vehicular task offloading systems, we present a survey on various RL/DRL techniques applied to vehicular task offloading. Precisely, we classify the vehicular task offloading works into two main categories: 1) RL/ DRL solutions leveraging EC and 2) RL/DRL solutions using VC computing. Moreover, the EC section-based RL/DRL solutions are further subcategorized into multiaccess edge computing (MEC) server, nearby vehicles, and hybrid MEC (HMEC). To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to cover RL/DRL-based vehicular task offloading. Also, we provide lessons learned and open research challenges in this field and discuss the possible trend for future research.",

    "title": "Q-learning Decision Transformer: Leveraging Dynamic Programming for Conditional Sequence Modelling in Offline RL",
    "abstract": "Recent works have shown that tackling offline reinforcement learning (RL) with a conditional policy produces promising results. The Decision Transformer (DT) combines the conditional policy approach and a transformer architecture, showing competitive performance against several benchmarks. However, DT lacks stitching ability -- one of the critical abilities for offline RL to learn the optimal policy from sub-optimal trajectories. This issue becomes particularly significant when the offline dataset only contains sub-optimal trajectories. On the other hand, the conventional RL approaches based on Dynamic Programming (such as Q-learning) do not have the same limitation; however, they suffer from unstable learning behaviours, especially when they rely on function approximation in an off-policy learning setting. In this paper, we propose the Q-learning Decision Transformer (QDT) to address the shortcomings of DT by leveraging the benefits of Dynamic Programming (Q-learning). It utilises the Dynamic Programming results to relabel the return-to-go in the training data to then train the DT with the relabelled data. Our approach efficiently exploits the benefits of these two approaches and compensates for each other's shortcomings to achieve better performance. We empirically show these in both simple toy environments and the more complex D4RL benchmark, showing competitive performance gains.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents an experimental study regarding the use of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT for robotics applications. We outline a strategy that combines design principles for prompt engineering and the creation of a high-level function library which allows ChatGPT to adapt to different robotics tasks, simulators, and form factors. We focus our evaluations on the effectiveness of different prompt engineering techniques and dialog strategies towards the execution of various types of robotics tasks. We explore ChatGPT\u2019s ability to use free-form dialog, parse XML tags, and to synthesize code, in addition to the use of task-specific prompting functions and closed-loop reasoning through dialogues. Our study encompasses a range of tasks within the robotics domain, from basic logical, geometrical, and mathematical reasoning all the way to complex domains such as aerial navigation, manipulation, and embodied agents. We show that ChatGPT can be effective at solving several of such tasks, while allowing users to interact with it primarily via natural language instructions. In addition to these studies, we introduce an open-sourced research tool called PromptCraft, which contains a platform where researchers can collaboratively upload and vote on examples of good prompting schemes for robotics applications, as well as a sample robotics simulator with ChatGPT integration, making it easier for users to get started with using ChatGPT for robotics.

    "abstract": "Building a robot that can understand and learn to interact by watching humans has inspired several vision problems. However, despite some successful results on static datasets, it remains unclear how current models can be used on a robot directly. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by leveraging videos of human interactions in an environment centric manner. Utilizing internet videos of human behavior, we train a visual affordance model that estimates where and how in the scene a human is likely to interact. The structure of these behavioral affordances directly enables the robot to perform many complex tasks. We show how to seamlessly integrate our affordance model with four robot learning paradigms including offline imitation learning, exploration, goal-conditioned learning, and action parameterization for reinforcement learning. We show the efficacy of our approach, which we call Vision-Robotics Bridge (VRB) across 4 real world environments, over 10 different tasks, and 2 robotic platforms operating in the wild.",

    "abstract": "We survey applications of pretrained foundation models in robotics. Traditional deep learning models in robotics are trained on small datasets tailored for specific tasks, which limits their adaptability across diverse applications. In contrast, foundation models pretrained on internet-scale data appear to have superior generalization capabilities, and in some instances display an emergent ability to find zero-shot solutions to problems that are not present in the training data. Foundation models may hold the potential to enhance various components of the robot autonomy stack, from perception to decision-making and control. For example, large language models can generate code or provide common sense reasoning, while vision-language models enable open-vocabulary visual recognition. However, significant open research challenges remain, particularly around the scarcity of robot-relevant training data, safety guarantees and uncertainty quantification, and real-time execution. In this survey, we study recent papers that have used or built foundation models to solve robotics problems. We explore how foundation models contribute to improving robot capabilities in the domains of perception, decision-making, and control. We discuss the challenges hindering the adoption of foundation models in robot autonomy and provide opportunities and potential pathways for future advancements.

    "abstract": "Recent work in visual representation learning for robotics demonstrates the viability of learning from large video datasets of humans performing everyday tasks. Leveraging methods such as masked autoencoding and contrastive learning, these representations exhibit strong transfer to policy learning for visuomotor control. But, robot learning encompasses a diverse set of problems beyond control including grasp affordance prediction, language-conditioned imitation learning, and intent scoring for human-robot collaboration, amongst others. First, we demonstrate that existing representations yield inconsistent results across these tasks: masked autoencoding approaches pick up on low-level spatial features at the cost of high-level semantics, while contrastive learning approaches capture the opposite. We then introduce Voltron, a framework for language-driven representation learning from human videos and associated captions. Voltron trades off language-conditioned visual reconstruction to learn low-level visual patterns, and visually-grounded language generation to encode high-level semantics. We also construct a new evaluation suite spanning five distinct robot learning problems $\\unicode{x2013}$ a unified platform for holistically evaluating visual representations for robotics. Through comprehensive, controlled experiments across all five problems, we find that Voltron's language-driven representations outperform the prior state-of-the-art, especially on targeted problems requiring higher-level features.",

    "abstract": "\u2014 Remarkable progress has been made in recent years in the fields of vision, language, and robotics. We now have vision models capable of recognizing objects based on language queries, navigation systems that can effectively control mobile systems, and grasping models that can handle a wide range of objects. Despite these advancements, general-purpose applications of robotics still lag behind, even though they rely on these fundamental capabilities of recognition, navigation, and grasping. In this paper, we adopt a systems-first approach to develop a new Open Knowledge-based robotics framework called OK-Robot . By combining Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for object detection, navigation primitives for movement, and grasping primitives for object manipulation, OK-Robot offers a integrated solution for pick-and-drop operations without requiring any training. To evaluate its performance, we run OK-Robot in 10 real-world home environments. The results demonstrate that OK-Robot achieves a 58.5% success rate in open-ended pick-and-drop tasks, representing a new state-of-the-art in Open Vocabulary Mobile Manipulation (OVMM) with nearly 1 . 8 \u00d7 the performance of prior work. On cleaner, uncluttered environments, OK-Robot \u2019s performance increases to 82%. However, the most important insight gained from OK-Robot is the critical role of nuanced details when combining Open Knowledge systems like VLMs with robotic modules.",

Simulation with rendering on ManiSkill3 can run 10-1000x faster with 2-3x less GPU memory usage than other platforms, achieving up to 30,000+ FPS in benchmarked environments due to minimal python/pytorch overhead in the system, simulation on the GPU, and the use of the SAPIEN parallel rendering system. Tasks that used to take hours to train can now take minutes. We further provide the most comprehensive range of GPU parallelized environments/tasks spanning 12 distinct domains including but not limited to mobile manipulation for tasks such as drawing, humanoids, and dextrous manipulation in realistic scenes designed by artists or real-world digital twins. In addition, millions of demonstration frames are provided from motion planning, RL, and teleoperation.

    "abstract": "We show that off-the-shelf text-based Transformers, with no additional training, can perform few-shot in-context visual imitation learning, mapping visual observations to action sequences that emulate the demonstrator's behaviour. We achieve this by transforming visual observations (inputs) and trajectories of actions (outputs) into sequences of tokens that a text-pretrained Transformer (GPT-4 Turbo) can ingest and generate, via a framework we call Keypoint Action Tokens (KAT). Despite being trained only on language, we show that these Transformers excel at translating tokenised visual keypoint observations into action trajectories, performing on par or better than state-of-the-art imitation learning (diffusion policies) in the low-data regime on a suite of real-world, everyday tasks. Rather than operating in the language domain as is typical, KAT leverages text-based Transformers to operate in the vision and action domains to learn general patterns in demonstration data for highly efficient imitation learning, indicating promising new avenues for repurposing natural language models for embodied tasks.

    "abstract": "An increasing number of machine learning tasks require dealing with large graph datasets, which capture rich and complex relation- ship among potentially billions of elements. Graph Neural Network (GNN) becomes an effective way to address the graph learning problem by converting the graph data into a low dimensional space while keeping both the structural and property information to the maximum extent and constructing a neural network for training and referencing. However, it is challenging to provide an efficient graph storage and computation capabilities to facilitate GNN training and enable development of new GNN algorithms. In this paper, we present a comprehensive graph neural network system, namely AliGraph, which consists of distributed graph storage, optimized sampling operators and runtime to efficiently support not only existing popular GNNs but also a series of in-house developed ones for different scenarios. The system is currently deployed at Alibaba to support a variety of business scenarios, including product recommendation and personalized search at Alibaba's E-Commerce platform. By conducting extensive experiments on a real-world dataset with 492.90 million vertices, 6.82 billion edges and rich attributes, Ali- Graph performs an order of magnitude faster in terms of graph building (5 minutes vs hours reported from the state-of-the-art PowerGraph platform). At training, AliGraph runs 40%-50% faster with the novel caching strategy and demonstrates around 12 times speed up with the improved runtime. In addition, our in-house developed GNN models all showcase their statistically significant superiorities in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency (e.g., 4.12% 17.19% lift by F1 scores).",

    "abstract": "We propose a novel deep learning approach for predicting drug-target interaction using a graph neural network. We introduce a distance-aware graph attention algorithm to differentiate various types of intermolecular interactions. Furthermore, we extract the graph feature of intermolecular interactions directly from the 3D structural information on the protein-ligand binding pose. Thus, the model can learn key features for accurate predictions of drug-target interaction rather than just memorize certain patterns of ligand molecules. As a result, our model shows better performance than docking and other deep learning methods for both virtual screening (AUROC of 0.968 for the DUD-E test set) and pose prediction (AUROC of 0.935 for the PDBbind test set). In addition, it can reproduce the natural population distribution of active molecules and inactive molecules.",

    "abstract": "Recently, researches have explored the graph neural network (GNN) techniques on text classification, since GNN does well in handling complex structures and preserving global information. However, previous methods based on GNN are mainly faced with the practical problems of fixed corpus level graph structure which don\u2019t support online testing and high memory consumption. To tackle the problems, we propose a new GNN based model that builds graphs for each input text with global parameters sharing instead of a single graph for the whole corpus. This method removes the burden of dependence between an individual text and entire corpus which support online testing, but still preserve global information. Besides, we build graphs by much smaller windows in the text, which not only extract more local features but also significantly reduce the edge numbers as well as memory consumption. Experiments show that our model outperforms existing models on several text classification datasets even with consuming less memory.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we focus on graph representation learning of heterogeneous information network (HIN), in which various types of vertices are connected by various types of relations. Most of the existing methods conducted on HIN revise homogeneous graph embedding models via meta-paths to learn low-dimensional vector space of HIN. In this paper, we propose a novel Heterogeneous Graph Structural Attention Neural Network (HetSANN) to directly encode structural information of HIN without meta-path and achieve more informative representations. With this method, domain experts will not be needed to design meta-path schemes and the heterogeneous information can be processed automatically by our proposed model. Specifically, we implicitly represent heterogeneous information using the following two methods: 1) we model the transformation between heterogeneous vertices through a projection in low-dimensional entity spaces; 2) afterwards, we apply the graph neural network to aggregate multi-relational information of projected neighborhood by means of attention mechanism. We also present three extensions of HetSANN, i.e., voices-sharing product attention for the pairwise relationships in HIN, cycle-consistency loss to retain the transformation between heterogeneous entity spaces, and multi-task learning with full use of information. The experiments conducted on three public datasets demonstrate that our proposed models achieve significant and consistent improvements compared to state-of-the-art solutions.",

However, the mechanisms of its pathogenesis remain largely unknown.\nMethods\n\nIn this study, we used weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to identify novel biomarkers associated with the prognosis of breast cancer. Gene expression profiles were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database.\nResults\n\nA total of 5 modules were identified via the average linkage hierarchical clustering. And a module significantly with the pathological grade was screened out. 33 genes with high connectivity in the clinically significant module were identified as hub genes.

Protein levels of CACS5 and RAD51 were also significantly higher in tumor tissues compared with normal tissues based on the analysis of the Human Protein Atlas. Convincingly, qRT-PCR analysis of breast cancer tissues and matched paracancerous tissue demonstrated that CACS5 and RAD51 were significantly upregulated in in breast cancer compared to paracancerous tissues. Further cell proliferation assay indicated that CACS5 and RAD51 depletion decreased cell proliferation capability.\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, our findings suggested that CASC5 and RAD51 could serve as biomarkers related to the prognosis of breast cancer and may be helpful for revealing pathogenic mechanism and developing further research.",

The research question is: do relationships among tourist enterprises affect the organizational asset of the Italian travel system? The research takes as unit of analysis the Italian travel agencies and tour operators system and represents quite a significant disclosure for organizational theses because it offers a different view over the structure and governance of a hospitality intermediaries\u2019 network. SNA is helpful indetecting genuine proficiency and therefore in foreseeing possible losses determined by poor or inefficient configurations. Furthermore, it will help delineate new roles within the organizational networks and evaluate the relation between formal and informal organizational structures. This paper provides a structural analysis of the Italian travel agencies network and highlights its self-organization characteristics (typical of a complex system) that lead to the development of informal communities. The methods of network science proved useful and effective and, together with more traditional approaches and a qualitative knowledge of the system, can provide a deeper and more extensive understanding of the system.",

    "abstract": "Network analysis can be used to identify central symptoms of eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa (AN), but the validity of this approach has been questioned. Using network analysis, in the present study we identify central symptoms of adult AN, identify key bridge symptoms between AN and anxiety/depression, and examine whether central symptoms at baseline are important predictors of treatment outcomes. We conducted network analyses for AN and comorbid depression and anxiety using longitudinal data (N = 142) with measurements at baseline, and at 6-month, 12-month, and 24-month postrandomization follow-ups. We identified central symptoms and bridge symptoms and tested whether centrality values calculated at baseline were related to the prognostic utility of symptoms longitudinally. Feeling fat and fear of weight gain were among the most central symptoms of AN. Feelings of worthlessness had the highest bridge centrality connecting depression to AN. Symptom centrality at baseline was strongly related to prognostic utility (r2 = .52, .55). The finding that symptom centrality was strongly related to prognostic utility supports the validity of network theory in that central symptoms may have a particularly strong influence on clinical impairment and recovery. These analyses generate useful hypotheses about the etiology and maintenance of AN and related comorbidities and may inform future treatment development.",

Influence of situational variables, team formation, and playing position on match running performance and social network analysis of brazilian professional soccer players. J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2018-The purpose of this study was to investigate the independent and interactive effects of situational variables, opposition team formation, and playing position on running performance and network analysis in Brazilian professional soccer players (n = 22). Global positioning system technology was used to determine total distance covered, mean speed, maximum running speed, and distance covered in 6 speed ranges. Social network analysis was used to assess interpersonal coordination (team interactions characterized as successful passes [n = 3,033] between teammates). Observations of match running performance (n = 129) and network analysis (n = 108) were obtained. The main results were: (a) no interactive effects between team formation and playing position were observed for running and network variables (unclear to possibly); (b) matches played at home or against \"weaker\" opponents presented greater running demands and individual/global metrics of network analysis (likely to almost certain); (c) match outcome demonstrated influence only for running performance; matches in which the reference team won resulted in higher values than in matches lost; (d) when the reference team competed in 1-4-4-2 formation, this resulted in greater running demands than 1-4-2-3-1 formation (likely to almost certain); (e) reduced values of running performance variables were reported in central defenders compared with other positions. Central/external midfielders reported greater closeness/betweenness centrality, outdegree, and eigenvector compared with central/external defenders and forwards (likely to almost certain). The results from this study provide practical information to potentially impact on physical, tactical, and technical training.",

    "abstract": "The prevalence of graph structures in real-world scenarios enables important tasks such as node classification and link prediction. Graphs in many domains follow a long-tailed distribution in their node degrees, i.e., a significant fraction of nodes are tail nodes with a small degree. Although recent graph neural networks (GNNs) can learn powerful node representations, they treat all nodes uniformly and are not tailored to the large group of tail nodes. In particular, there is limited structural information (i.e., links) on tail nodes, resulting in inferior performance. Toward robust tail node embedding, in this paper we propose a novel graph neural network called Tail-GNN. It hinges on the novel concept of transferable neighborhood translation, to model the variable ties between a target node and its neighbors. On one hand, Tail-GNN learns a neighborhood translation from the structurally rich head nodes (i.e., high-degree nodes), which can be further transferred to the structurally limited tail nodes to enhance their representations. On the other hand, the ties with the neighbors are variable across different parts of the graph, and a global neighborhood translation is inflexible. Thus, we devise a node-wise adaptation to localize the global translation w.r.t. each node. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed Tail-GNN significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.",

    "abstract": "GNN-based anomaly detection has recently attracted considerable attention. Existing attempts have thus far focused on jointly learning the node representations and the classifier for detecting the anomalies. Inspired by the recent advances of self-supervised learning (SSL) on graphs, we explore another possibility of decoupling the node representation learning and the classification for anomaly detection. We conduct a preliminary study to show that decoupled training using existing graph SSL schemes to represent nodes can obtain performance gains over joint training, but it may deteriorate when the behavior patterns and the label semantics become highly inconsistent. To be less biased by the inconsistency, we propose a simple yet effective graph SSL scheme, called Deep Cluster Infomax (DCI) for node representation learning, which captures the intrinsic graph properties in more concentrated feature spaces by clustering the entire graph into multiple parts. We conduct extensive experiments on four real-world datasets for anomaly detection. The results demonstrate that decoupled training equipped with a proper SSL scheme can outperform joint training in AUC. Compared with existing graph SSL schemes, DCI can help decoupled training gain more improvements.",

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely used on a variety of graph-based machine learning tasks. For node-level tasks, GNNs have strong power to model the homophily property of graphs (i.e., connected nodes are more similar), while their ability to capture heterophily property is often doubtful. This is partially caused by the design of the feature transformation with the same kernel for the nodes in the same hop and the followed aggregation operator. One kernel cannot model the similarity and the dissimilarity (i.e., the positive and negative correlation) between node features simultaneously even though we use attention mechanisms like Graph Attention Network (GAT), since the weight calculated by attention is always a positive value. In this paper, we propose a novel GNN model based on a bi-kernel feature transformation and a selection gate. Two kernels capture homophily and heterophily information respectively, and the gate is introduced to select which kernel we should use for the given node pairs. We conduct extensive experiments on various datasets with different homophily-heterophily properties. The experimental results show consistent and significant improvements against state-of-the-art GNN methods.",

    "abstract": "Network architecture plays a key role in the deep learning-based computer vision system. The widely-used convolutional neural network and transformer treat the image as a grid or sequence structure, which is not flexible to capture irregular and complex objects. In this paper, we propose to represent the image as a graph structure and introduce a new Vision GNN (ViG) architecture to extract graph-level feature for visual tasks. We first split the image to a number of patches which are viewed as nodes, and construct a graph by connecting the nearest neighbors. Based on the graph representation of images, we build our ViG model to transform and exchange information among all the nodes. ViG consists of two basic modules: Grapher module with graph convolution for aggregating and updating graph information, and FFN module with two linear layers for node feature transformation. Both isotropic and pyramid architectures of ViG are built with different model sizes. Extensive experiments on image recognition and object detection tasks demonstrate the superiority of our ViG architecture. We hope this pioneering study of GNN on general visual tasks will provide useful inspiration and experience for future research.

To evaluate the FP-GNN model, we conducted experiments on 13 public datasets, an unbiased LIT-PCBA dataset and 14 phenotypic screening datasets for breast cell lines. Extensive evaluation results showed that compared to advanced deep learning and conventional machine learning algorithms, the FP-GNN algorithm achieved state-of-the-art performance on these datasets. In addition, we analyzed the influence of different molecular fingerprints, and the effects of molecular graphs and molecular fingerprints on the performance of the FP-GNN model. Analysis of the anti-noise ability and interpretation ability also indicated that FP-GNN was competitive in real-world situations.

    "title": "H2-FDetector: A GNN-based Fraud Detector with Homophilic and Heterophilic Connections",
    "abstract": "In the fraud graph, fraudsters often interact with a large number of benign entities to hide themselves. So, there are not only the homophilic connections formed by the same label nodes (similar nodes), but also the heterophilic connections formed by the different label nodes (dissimilar nodes). However, the existing GNN-based fraud detection methods just enhance the homophily in fraud graph and use the low-pass filter to retain the commonality of node features among the neighbors, which inevitably ignore the difference among neighbor of heterophilic connections. To address this problem, we propose a Graph Neural Network-based Fraud Detector with Homophilic and Heterophilic Interactions (H2-FDetector for short). Firstly, we identify the homophilic and heterophilic connections with the supervision of labeled nodes. Next, we design a new information aggregation strategy to make the homophilic connections propagate similar information and the heterophilic connections propagate difference information. Finally, a prototype prior is introduced to guide the identification of fraudsters. Extensive experiments on two real public benchmark fraud detection tasks demonstrate that our method apparently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.",

    "abstract": "Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is one of the most common imaging modalities to investigate brain functions. Recent studies in neuroscience stress the great potential of functional brain networks constructed from fMRI data for clinical predictions. Traditional functional brain networks, however, are noisy and unaware of downstream prediction tasks, while also incompatible with the deep graph neural network (GNN) models. In order to fully unleash the power of GNNs in network-based fMRI analysis, we develop FBNETGEN, a task-aware and interpretable fMRI analysis framework via deep brain network generation. In particular, we formulate (1) prominent region of interest (ROI) features extraction, (2) brain networks generation, and (3) clinical predictions with GNNs, in an end-to-end trainable model under the guidance of particular prediction tasks. Along with the process, the key novel component is the graph generator which learns to transform raw time-series features into task-oriented brain networks. Our learnable graphs also provide unique interpretations by highlighting prediction-related brain regions. Comprehensive experiments on two datasets, i.e., the recently released and currently largest publicly available fMRI dataset Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD), and the widely-used fMRI dataset PNC, prove the superior effectiveness and interpretability of FBNETGEN. The implementation is available at https://github.com/Wayfear/FBNETGEN.",

    "abstract": "We propose GNNLab, a sample-based GNN training system in a single machine multi-GPU setup. GNNLab adopts a factored design for multiple GPUs, where each GPU is dedicated to the task of graph sampling or model training. It accelerates both tasks by eliminating GPU memory contention. To balance GPU workloads, GNNLab applies a global queue to bridge GPUs asynchronously and adopts a simple yet effective method to adaptively allocate GPUs for different tasks. GNNLab further leverages temporarily switching to avoid idle waiting on GPUs. Furthermore, GNNLab proposes a new pre-sampling based caching policy that takes both sampling algorithms and GNN datasets into account, and shows an efficient and robust caching performance. Evaluations on three representative GNN models and four real-life graphs show that GNNLab outperforms the state-of-the-art GNN systems DGL and PyG by up to 9.1\u00d7 (from 2.4\u00d7) and 74.3\u00d7 (from 10.2\u00d7), respectively. In addition, our pre-sampling based caching policy achieves 90% -- 99% of the optimal cache hit rate in all experiments.",

The important nodes in the network are mainly developed countries such as Europe and the United States, and the node polarization effect has weakened; the network has four agglomeration subgroups. The phenomenon of subgroups and factions is not obvious. Further factor identification shows that economic factors and technological information factors have the strongest correlation with the innovation network and that demographic factors have a weaker correlation with the innovation network. In addition, China's position in the innovation network has been increasing year by year, and the role of \u2018transit stations\u2019 has become increasingly prominent.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the most relevant hematological/biochemical characteristics, pre-existing health conditions and complications in survivors and non-survivor will aid in predicting COVID-19 patient mortality, as well as intensive care unit (ICU) referral and death. A literature review was conducted for COVID-19 mortality in PubMed, Scopus, and various preprint servers (bioRxiv, medRxiv and SSRN), with 97 observational studies and preprints, consisting of survivor and non-survivor sub-populations. This meta/network analysis comprised 19,014 COVID-19 patients, consisting of 14,359 survivors and 4655 non-survivors. Meta and network analyses were performed using META-MAR V2.7.0 and PAST software. The study revealed that non-survivors of COVID-19 had elevated levels of gamma-glutamyl transferase and creatinine, as well as a higher number of neutrophils. Non-survivors had fewer lymphocytes and platelets, as well as lower hemoglobin and albumin concentrations. Age, hypertension, and cerebrovascular disease were shown to be the most influential risk factors among non-survivors. The most common complication among non-survivors was heart failure, followed by septic shock and respiratory failure. Platelet counts, creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase, albumin, and blood urea nitrogen levels were all linked to ICU admission. Hemoglobin levels preferred non-ICU patients. Lower levels of hemoglobin, lymphocytes, and albumin were associated with increased mortality in ICU patients. This meta-analysis showed that inexpensive and fast biochemical and hematological tests, as well as pre-existing conditions and complications, can be used to estimate the risk of mortality in COVID-19 patients.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge Graphs (KGs) represent human-crafted factual knowledge in the form of triplets (head, relation, tail), which collectively form a graph. Question Answering over KGs (KGQA) is the task of answering natural questions grounding the reasoning to the information provided by the KG. Large Language Models (LLMs) are the state-of-the-art models for QA tasks due to their remarkable ability to understand natural language. On the other hand, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely used for KGQA as they can handle the complex graph information stored in the KG. In this work, we introduce GNN-RAG, a novel method for combining language understanding abilities of LLMs with the reasoning abilities of GNNs in a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) style. First, a GNN reasons over a dense KG subgraph to retrieve answer candidates for a given question. Second, the shortest paths in the KG that connect question entities and answer candidates are extracted to represent KG reasoning paths. The extracted paths are verbalized and given as input for LLM reasoning with RAG. In our GNN-RAG framework, the GNN acts as a dense subgraph reasoner to extract useful graph information, while the LLM leverages its natural language processing ability for ultimate KGQA. Furthermore, we develop a retrieval augmentation (RA) technique to further boost KGQA performance with GNN-RAG. Experimental results show that GNN-RAG achieves state-of-the-art performance in two widely used KGQA benchmarks (WebQSP and CWQ), outperforming or matching GPT-4 performance with a 7B tuned LLM. In addition, GNN-RAG excels on multi-hop and multi-entity questions outperforming competing approaches by 8.9--15.5% points at answer F1.",

    "title": "Can GNN be Good Adapter for LLMs?",
    "abstract": "Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated superior capabilities in understanding and zero-shot learning on textual data, promising significant advances for many text-related domains. In the graph domain, various real-world scenarios also involve textual data, where tasks and node features can be described by text. These text-attributed graphs (TAGs) have broad applications in social media, recommendation systems, etc. Thus, this paper explores how to utilize LLMs to model TAGs. Previous methods for TAG modeling are based on million-scale LMs. When scaled up to billion-scale LLMs, they face huge challenges in computational costs. Additionally, they also ignore the zero-shot inference capabilities of LLMs. Therefore, we propose GraphAdapter, which uses a graph neural network (GNN) as an efficient adapter in collaboration with LLMs to tackle TAGs. In terms of efficiency, the GNN adapter introduces only a few trainable parameters and can be trained with low computation costs. The entire framework is trained using auto-regression on node text (next token prediction). Once trained, GraphAdapter can be seamlessly fine-tuned with task-specific prompts for various downstream tasks. Through extensive experiments across multiple real-world TAGs, GraphAdapter based on Llama 2 gains an average improvement of approximately 5% in terms of node classification. Furthermore, GraphAdapter can also adapt to other language models, including RoBERTa, GPT-2. The promising results demonstrate that GNNs can serve as effective adapters for LLMs in TAG modeling.",

    "abstract": "Designing expressive Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is a fundamental topic in the graph learning community. So far, GNN expressiveness has been primarily assessed via the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) hierarchy. However, such an expressivity measure has notable limitations: it is inherently coarse, qualitative, and may not well reflect practical requirements (e.g., the ability to encode substructures). In this paper, we introduce a unified framework for quantitatively studying the expressiveness of GNN architectures, addressing all the above limitations. Specifically, we identify a fundamental expressivity measure termed homomorphism expressivity, which quantifies the ability of GNN models to count graphs under homomorphism. Homomorphism expressivity offers a complete and practical assessment tool: the completeness enables direct expressivity comparisons between GNN models, while the practicality allows for understanding concrete GNN abilities such as subgraph counting. By examining four classes of prominent GNNs as case studies, we derive simple, unified, and elegant descriptions of their homomorphism expressivity for both invariant and equivariant settings. Our results provide novel insights into a series of previous work, unify the landscape of different subareas in the community, and settle several open questions. Empirically, extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world tasks verify our theory, showing that the practical performance of GNN models aligns well with the proposed metric.",

    "abstract": "Zero-shot graph machine learning, especially with graph neural networks (GNNs), has garnered significant interest due to the challenge of scarce labeled data. While methods like self-supervised learning and graph prompt learning have been extensively explored, they often rely on fine-tuning with task-specific labels, limiting their effectiveness in zero-shot scenarios. Inspired by the zero-shot capabilities of instruction-fine-tuned large language models (LLMs), we introduce a novel framework named Token Embedding-Aligned Graph Language Model (TEA-GLM) that leverages LLMs as cross-dataset and cross-task zero-shot learners for graph machine learning. Concretely, we pretrain a GNN, aligning its representations with token embeddings of an LLM. We then train a linear projector that transforms the GNN's representations into a fixed number of graph token embeddings without tuning the LLM. A unified instruction is designed for various graph tasks at different levels, such as node classification (node-level) and link prediction (edge-level). These design choices collectively enhance our method's effectiveness in zero-shot learning, setting it apart from existing methods. Experiments show that our graph token embeddings help the LLM predictor achieve state-of-the-art performance on unseen datasets and tasks compared to other methods using LLMs as predictors.",

    "abstract": "In large-scale computation of physics problems, one often encounters the problem of determining a multi-dimensional function, which can be time-consuming when computing each point in this multi-dimensional space is already time-demanding. In the work, we propose that the active learning algorithm can speed up such calculations. The basic idea is to fit a multi-dimensional function by neural networks, and the key point is to make the query of labeled data economically by using a stratagem called \"query by committee\". We present the general protocol of this fitting scheme, as well as the procedure of how to further compute physical observables with the fitted functions. We show that this method can work well with two examples, which are quantum three-body problem in atomic physics and the anomalous Hall conductivity in condensed matter physics, respectively. In these examples, we show that one reaches an accuracy of few percent error for computing physical observables with less than $10\\%$ of total data points compared with uniform sampling. With these two examples, we also visualize that by using the active learning algorithm, the required data are added mostly in the regime where the function varies most rapidly, which explains the mechanism for the efficiency of the algorithm. We expect broad applications of our method on various kind of computational physics problems.",

    "title": "Subsurface Boundary Geometry Modeling: Applying Computational Physics, Computer Vision, and Signal Processing Techniques to Geoscience",
    "abstract": "This paper describes an interdisciplinary approach to geometry modeling of geospatial boundaries. The objective is to extract surfaces from irregular spatial patterns using differential geometry and obtain coherent directional predictions along the boundary of extracted surfaces to enable more targeted sampling and exploration. Specific difficulties of the data include sparsity, incompleteness, causality and resolution disparity. Surface slopes are estimated using only sparse samples from cross-sections within a geological domain with no other information at intermediate depths. From boundary detection to subsurface reconstruction, processes are automated in between. The key problems to be solved are boundary extraction, region correspondence and propagation of the boundaries via contour morphing. Established techniques from computational physics, computer vision and signal processing are used with appropriate modifications to address challenges in each area. To facilitate boundary extraction, an edge map synthesis procedure is presented. This works with connected component analysis, anisotropic diffusion and active contours to convert unordered points into regularized boundaries. For region correspondence, component relationships are handled via graphical decomposition. FFT-based spatial alignment strategies are used in region merging and splitting scenarios. Shape changes between aligned regions are described by contour metamorphosis. Specifically, local spatial deformation is modeled by PDE and computed using level-set methods. Directional predictions are obtained using particle trajectories by following the evolving boundary. However, when a branching point is encountered, particles may lose track of the wavefront. To overcome this, a curvelet backtracking algorithm has been proposed to recover information for boundary segments without particle coverage to minimize shape distortion.",

    "abstract": "Following the publication of the first human genome, OMICs research, including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metagenomics, has been on the rise. OMICs studies revealed the complex genetic diversity among human populations and challenged our understandings of genotype-phenotype correlations. Africa, being the cradle of the first modern humans, is distinguished by a large genetic diversity within its populations and rich ethnolinguistic history. However, the available human OMICs tools and databases are not representative of this diversity, therefore creating significant gaps in biomedical research. African scientists, students, and publics are among the key contributors to OMICs systems science. This expert review examines the pressing issues in human OMICs research, education, and development in Africa, as seen through a lens of computational biology, public health relevant technology innovation, critically-informed science governance, and how best to harness OMICs data to benefit health and societies in Africa and beyond. We underscore the disparities between North and Sub-Saharan Africa at different levels. A harmonized African ethnolinguistic classification would help address annotation challenges associated with population diversity. Finally, building on the existing strategic research initiatives, such as the H3Africa and H3ABioNet Consortia, we highly recommend addressing large-scale multidisciplinary research challenges, strengthening research collaborations and knowledge transfer, and enhancing the ability of African researchers to influence and shape national and international research, policy, and funding agendas. This article and analysis contribute to a deeper understanding of past and current challenges in the African OMICs innovation ecosystem, while also offering foresight on future innovation trajectories.",

We believe that in order to pave the way for the next generation of discoveries, we need to improve recognition for computational biologists and better align pathways of career success with pathways of scientific progress.

    "abstract": "Motivation This paper introduces Vivarium \u2013 software born of the idea that it should be as easy as possible for computational biologists to define any imaginable mechanistic model, combine it with existing models, and execute them together as an integrated multiscale model. Integrative multiscale modeling confronts the complexity of biology by combining heterogeneous datasets and diverse modeling strategies into unified representations. These integrated models are then run to simulate how the hypothesized mechanisms operate as a whole. But building such models has been a labor-intensive process that requires many contributors, and they are still primarily developed on a case-by-case basis with each project starting anew. New software tools that streamline the integrative modeling effort and facilitate collaboration are therefore essential for future computational biologists. Results Vivarium is a Pythonic software for building integrative multiscale models. It provides an interface that makes individual models into modules that can be wired together in large composite models, parallelized across multiple CPUs, and run with Vivarium\u2019s simulation engine. Vivarium\u2019s utility is demonstrated by building composite models that combine several modeling frameworks: agent based models, ordinary differential equations, stochastic reaction systems, constraint-based models, solid-body physics, and spatial diffusion. This demonstrates just the beginning of what is possible \u2013 future efforts can integrate many more types of models and at many more biological scales. Availability The models, simulation pipelines, and notebooks developed for this paper are available at the vivarium-notebooks repository: https://github.com/vivarium-collective/vivarium-notebooks. Vivarium-core is available at https://github.com/vivarium-collective/vivarium-core, and has been released on PyPI. The Vivarium Collective (https://vivarium-collective.github.io) is a repository of freely-available Vivarium processes and composites, including the processes used in Section 3. Supplementary materials provide with an extensive methodology section, with several code listings that demonstrate the basic interfaces.",

    "abstract": "Similarities in the hijacking mechanisms used by SARS-CoV-2 and several types of cancer, suggest the repurposing of cancer drugs to treat Covid-19. CK2 kinase antagonists have been proposed for cancer treatment. A recent study in cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 found a significant CK2 kinase activity, and the use of a CK2 inhibitor showed antiviral responses. CIGB-300, originally designed as an anticancer peptide, is an antagonist of CK2 kinase activity that binds to the CK2 phospho-acceptor sites. Recent preliminary results show the antiviral activity of CIGB-300 using a surrogate model of coronavirus. Here we present a computational biology study that provides evidence, at the molecular level, of how CIGB-300 may interfere with the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle within infected human cells. Sequence analyses and data from phosphorylation studies were combined to predict infection-induced molecular mechanisms that can be interfered by CIGB-300. Next, we integrated data from multi-omics studies and data focusing on the antagonistic effect on the CK2 kinase activity of CIGB-300. A combination of network and functional enrichment analyses was used. Firstly, from the SARS-CoV studies, we inferred the potential incidence of CIGB-300 in SARS-CoV-2 interference on the immune response. Afterwards, from the analysis of multiple omics data, we proposed the action of CIGB-300 from the early stages of viral infections perturbing the virus hijacking of RNA splicing machinery. We also predicted the interference of CIGB-300 in virus-host interactions that are responsible for the high infectivity and the particular immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, we provided evidence of how CIGB-300 may participate in the attenuation of phenotypes related to muscle, bleeding, coagulation and respiratory disorders. Our computational analysis proposes putative molecular mechanisms that support the antiviral activity of CIGB-300.",

    "abstract": "Recent breakthroughs in computing power have made it feasible to use machine learning and deep learning to advance scientific computing in many fields, including fluid mechanics, solid mechanics, materials science, etc. Neural networks, in particular, play a central role in this hybridization. Due to their intrinsic architecture, conventional neural networks cannot be successfully trained and scoped when data is sparse, which is the case in many scientific and engineering domains. Nonetheless, neural networks provide a solid foundation to respect physics-driven or knowledge-based constraints during training. Generally speaking, there are three distinct neural network frameworks to enforce the underlying physics: (i) physics-guided neural networks (PgNNs), (ii) physics-informed neural networks (PiNNs), and (iii) physics-encoded neural networks (PeNNs). These methods provide distinct advantages for accelerating the numerical modeling of complex multiscale multi-physics phenomena. In addition, the recent developments in neural operators (NOs) add another dimension to these new simulation paradigms, especially when the real-time prediction of complex multi-physics systems is required. All these models also come with their own unique drawbacks and limitations that call for further fundamental research. This study aims to present a review of the four neural network frameworks (i.e., PgNNs, PiNNs, PeNNs, and NOs) used in scientific computing research. The state-of-the-art architectures and their applications are reviewed, limitations are discussed, and future research opportunities in terms of improving algorithms, considering causalities, expanding applications, and coupling scientific and deep learning solvers are presented. This critical review provides researchers and engineers with a solid starting point to comprehend how to integrate different layers of physics into neural networks.",

Such hybrid models combine first principle-based models with data-based models into a joint architecture. This paper will give some background, explain trends and showcase recent achievements from an applied mathematics and industrial perspective. Examples include characterization of superconducting accelerator magnets by blending data with physics, data-driven magnetostatic field simulation without an explicit model of the constitutive law, and Bayesian free-shape optimization of a trace pair with bend on a printed circuit board.",

    "abstract": "In the current music education, the music teaching method is too simple, boring, relatively backward, unable to attract the attention of the students, and the students gradually lose their interest in music courses. In basic education, music, as a highly practical subject, must create a good classroom atmosphere, make the classroom active, and enable students to better experience music, enjoy music, and like music. Therefore, in order to change this situation, this paper, based on scientific computing visualization, studies the application of computer music technology in basic education music teaching, and proposes a related computing method based on scientific computing visualization-image segmentation method. This review compares the spectrum extraction accuracy between the improved algorithm and the two traditional algorithms and finds that the average accuracy of the improved algorithm is 90.88%. It can be seen that the method proposed in this review is more suitable for the study of computer music technology in basic education music teaching. Applied research and most students are more interested in music teaching combined with computer music technology, so learning music teaching combined with computer music technology is very necessary. The development of computer music technology is closely related to the development of modern information technology.",

    "abstract": "This report is a digest of the DOE/NSF Workshop on Correctness in Scientific Computing (CSC'23) held on June 17, 2023, as part of the Federated Computing Research Conference (FCRC) 2023. CSC was conceived by DOE and NSF to address the growing concerns about correctness among those who employ computational methods to perform large-scale scientific simulations. These concerns have escalated, given the complexity, scale, and heterogeneity of today's HPC software and hardware. If correctness is not proactively addressed, there is the risk of producing flawed science on top of unacceptable productivity losses faced by computational scientists and engineers. HPC systems are beginning to include data-driven methods, including machine learning and surrogate models, and their impact on overall HPC system correctness was also felt urgent to discuss. Stakeholders of correctness in this space were identified to belong to several sub-disciplines of computer science; from computer architecture researchers who design special-purpose hardware that offers high energy efficiencies; numerical algorithm designers who develop efficient computational schemes based on reduced precision as well as reduced data movement; all the way to researchers in programming language and formal methods who seek methodologies for correct compilation and verification. To include attendees with such a diverse set of backgrounds, CSC was held during the Federated Computing Research Conference (FCRC) 2023.",

    "abstract": "Complicated manual calculation and drawing often appear in circuit analysis, which brings difficulty to circuit analysis. Manual ways to analysis of the circuit is timeconsuming and laborious, and prone to errors. Python can solve the problem better in circuit analysis instead of manual ways. Python is a high-level, general-purpose interpreted programming language that is widely used in scientific computing and engineering. It also includes a vast collection of Python packages for scientific computing. This ecosystem of scientifically oriented libraries ranges from generic core libraries\u2013 such as NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib \u2013to more specific libraries for particular problem domains [1]. 1So Python has many applications in circuit analysis, such as equation solving, curve drawing, logic calculation and so on. In this paper, we apply Sympy library of Python to solve the equations of branch current method, use Matplotlib library to draw the sinusoidal AC signal curve, and use programming language of Python to realize the design of logic which is also the realization of logic functions. With the rapid development of computer technology, the application of new technology and software tools in circuit analysis will greatly improve the efficiency of circuit analysis.",

    "abstract": "Critical goals of scientific computing are to increase scientific rigor, reproducibility, and transparency while keeping up with ever-increasing computational demands. This work presents an integrated framework well-suited for data processing and analysis spanning individual, on-premises, and cloud environments. This framework leverages three well-established DevOps tools: 1) Git repositories linked to 2) CI/CD engines operating on 3) containers. It supports the full life-cycle of scientific data workflows with minimal friction between stages--including solutions for researchers who generate data. This is achieved by leveraging a single container that supports local, interactive user sessions and deployment in HPC or Kubernetes clusters. Combined with Git repositories integrated with CI/CD, this approach enables decentralized data pipelines across multiple, arbitrary computational environments. This framework has been successfully deployed and validated within our research group, spanning experimental acquisition systems and computational clusters with open-source, purpose-built GitLab CI/CD executors for slurm and Google Kubernetes Engine Autopilot. Taken together, this framework can increase the rigor, reproducibility, and transparency of compute-dependent scientific research.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, interactive digital scientific environments have become an integral part of scientific computing in solving various scientific tasks in research, but also in STEM education. We introduce SageMath, or shortly Sage \u23af a free open Python-based alternative to the well-known commercial software \u23af in the frame of our course Methods of Physical Problems Solving for future scientists and science teachers. Particularly, in the 1st illustrative example from the Physics Olympiad, we present Sage as a scientific open data source, symbolic, numerical, and visualization tool. The 2nd example from the Young Physicists\u2019 Tournament shows Sage as a multimedia, modeling, and programming tool. By employing SageMath as an open digital environment for scientific computing in the education of all STEM disciplines, teachers and students are empowered not only with a universal educational tool, but a real research tool, enabling them to engage in interactive visualization, modeling, programming, and solving of authentic, complex interdisciplinary problems, thus naturally enhancing their motivation to pursue science in alignment with the core mission of STEM education.",

In cases of fatal diseases like Melanoma diagnosis in early stages play a vital role in determining the probability of getting cured. We believe that the application of automated methods will help in early diagnosis especially with the set of images with variety of diagnosis. Hence, in this article we present a completely automated system of dermatological disease recognition through lesion images, a machine intervention in contrast to conventional medical personnel-based detection. Our model is designed into three phases compromising of data collection and augmentation, designing model and finally prediction. We have used multiple AI algorithms like Convolutional Neural Network and Support Vector Machine and amalgamated it with image processing tools to form a better structure, leading to higher accuracy of 85%.",

    "abstract": "Imaging the perivascular spaces (PVS), also known as Virchow-Robin space, has significant clinical value, but there remains a need for neuroimaging techniques to improve mapping and quantification of the PVS. Current technique for PVS evaluation is a scoring system based on visual reading of visible PVS in regions of interest, and often limited to large caliber PVS. Enhancing the visibility of the PVS could support medical diagnosis and enable novel neuroscientific investigations. Increasing the MRI resolution is one approach to enhance the visibility of PVS but is limited by acquisition time and physical constraints. Alternatively, image processing approaches can be utilized to improve the contrast ratio between PVS and surrounding tissue. Here we combine T1- and T2-weighted images to enhance PVS contrast, intensifying the visibility of PVS. The Enhanced PVS Contrast (EPC) was achieved by combining T1- and T2-weighted images that were adaptively filtered to remove non-structured high-frequency spatial noise. EPC was evaluated on healthy young adults by presenting them to two expert readers and also through automated quantification. We found that EPC improves the conspicuity of the PVS and aid resolving a larger number of PVS. We also present a highly reliable automated PVS quantification approach, which was optimized using expert readings.",

    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning methods have witnessed a recent surge of interest after proving successful in multiple application fields. In this work, we leverage these techniques, and we propose 3D versions for five different self-supervised methods, in the form of proxy tasks. Our methods facilitate neural network feature learning from unlabeled 3D images, aiming to reduce the required cost for expert annotation. The developed algorithms are 3D Contrastive Predictive Coding, 3D Rotation prediction, 3D Jigsaw puzzles, Relative 3D patch location, and 3D Exemplar networks. Our experiments show that pretraining models with our 3D tasks yields more powerful semantic representations, and enables solving downstream tasks more accurately and efficiently, compared to training the models from scratch and to pretraining them on 2D slices. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on three downstream tasks from the medical imaging domain: i) Brain Tumor Segmentation from 3D MRI, ii) Pancreas Tumor Segmentation from 3D CT, and iii) Diabetic Retinopathy Detection from 2D Fundus images. In each task, we assess the gains in data-efficiency, performance, and speed of convergence. Interestingly, we also find gains when transferring the learned representations, by our methods, from a large unlabeled 3D corpus to a small downstream-specific dataset. We achieve results competitive to state-of-the-art solutions at a fraction of the computational expense. We publish our implementations for the developed algorithms (both 3D and 2D versions) as an open-source library, in an effort to allow other researchers to apply and extend our methods on their datasets.",

    "title": "Review of deep learning: concepts, CNN architectures, challenges, applications, future directions",
    "abstract": "In the last few years, the deep learning (DL) computing paradigm has been deemed the Gold Standard in the machine learning (ML) community. Moreover, it has gradually become the most widely used computational approach in the field of ML, thus achieving outstanding results on several complex cognitive tasks, matching or even beating those provided by human performance. One of the benefits of DL is the ability to learn massive amounts of data. The DL field has grown fast in the last few years and it has been extensively used to successfully address a wide range of traditional applications. More importantly, DL has outperformed well-known ML techniques in many domains, e.g., cybersecurity, natural language processing, bioinformatics, robotics and control, and medical information processing, among many others. Despite it has been contributed several works reviewing the State-of-the-Art on DL, all of them only tackled one aspect of the DL, which leads to an overall lack of knowledge about it. Therefore, in this contribution, we propose using a more holistic approach in order to provide a more suitable starting point from which to develop a full understanding of DL. Specifically, this review attempts to provide a more comprehensive survey of the most important aspects of DL and including those enhancements recently added to the field. In particular, this paper outlines the importance of DL, presents the types of DL techniques and networks. It then presents convolutional neural networks (CNNs) which the most utilized DL network type and describes the development of CNNs architectures together with their main features, e.g., starting with the AlexNet network and closing with the High-Resolution network (HR.Net). Finally, we further present the challenges and suggested solutions to help researchers understand the existing research gaps. It is followed by a list of the major DL applications. Computational tools including FPGA, GPU, and CPU are summarized along with a description of their influence on DL. The paper ends with the evolution matrix, benchmark datasets, and summary and conclusion.",

    "abstract": "Despite their massive size, successful deep artificial neural networks can exhibit a remarkably small gap between training and test performance. Conventional wisdom attributes small generalization error either to properties of the model family or to the regularization techniques used during training. Through extensive systematic experiments, we show how these traditional approaches fail to explain why large neural networks generalize well in practice. Specifically, our experiments establish that state-of-the-art convolutional networks for image classification trained with stochastic gradient methods easily fit a random labeling of the training data. This phenomenon is qualitatively unaffected by explicit regularization and occurs even if we replace the true images by completely unstructured random noise. We corroborate these experimental findings with a theoretical construction showing that simple depth two neural networks already have perfect finite sample expressivity as soon as the number of parameters exceeds the number of data points as it usually does in practice. We interpret our experimental findings by comparison with traditional models. We supplement this republication with a new section at the end summarizing recent progresses in the field since the original version of this paper.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning (DL), a branch of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) is nowadays considered as a core technology of today\u2019s Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR or Industry 4.0). Due to its learning capabilities from data, DL technology originated from artificial neural network (ANN), has become a hot topic in the context of computing, and is widely applied in various application areas like healthcare, visual recognition, text analytics, cybersecurity, and many more. However, building an appropriate DL model is a challenging task, due to the dynamic nature and variations in real-world problems and data. Moreover, the lack of core understanding turns DL methods into black-box machines that hamper development at the standard level. This article presents a structured and comprehensive view on DL techniques including a taxonomy considering various types of real-world tasks like supervised or unsupervised. In our taxonomy, we take into account deep networks for supervised or discriminative learning, unsupervised or generative learning as well as hybrid learning and relevant others. We also summarize real-world application areas where deep learning techniques can be used. Finally, we point out ten potential aspects for future generation DL modeling with research directions. Overall, this article aims to draw a big picture on DL modeling that can be used as a reference guide for both academia and industry professionals.",

    "abstract": "Recent progress on Transformers and multilayer perceptron (MLP) models provide new network architectural designs for computer vision tasks. Although these models proved to be effective in many vision tasks such as image recognition, there remain challenges in adapting them for lowlevel vision. The inflexibility to support high-resolution images and limitations of local attention are perhaps the main bottlenecks. In this work, we present a multi-axis MLP based architecture called MAXIM, that can serve as an efficient and flexible general-purpose vision backbone for image processing tasks. MAXIM uses a UNet-shaped hierarchical structure and supports long-range interactions enabled by spatially-gated MLPs. Specifically, MAXIM contains two MLP-based building blocks: a multi-axis gated MLP that allows for efficient and scalable spatial mixing of local and global visual cues, and a cross-gating block, an alternative to cross-attention, which accounts for cross-feature conditioning. Both these modules are exclusively based on MLPs, but also benefit from being both global and \u2018fully-convolutional\u2019, two properties that are desirable for image processing. Our extensive experimental results show that the proposed MAXIM model achieves state-of-the-art performance on more than ten benchmarks across a range of image processing tasks, including denoising, deblurring, de raining, dehazing, and enhancement while requiring fewer or comparable numbers of parameters and FLOPs than competitive models.

    "abstract": "Combining rich spectral and spatial information, a hyperspectral image (HSI) can provide a more comprehensive characterization of the Earth\u2019s surface. To better exploit HSIs, a large number of algorithms have been developed during the past few decades. Due to their very high correlation between spectral channels and spatial pixels, HSIs have intrinsically sparse and low-rank structures. The sparse representation (SR) and low-rank representation (LRR)-based methods have proven to be powerful tools for HSI processing and are widely used in different HS fields. In this article, we present a survey of low-rank and sparse-based HSI processing methods in the fields of denoising, superresolution, dimension reduction, unmixing, classification, and anomaly detection. The purpose is to provide guidelines and inspiration to practitioners for promoting the development of HSI processing.

    "abstract": "Breast cancer is the most lethal type of cancer for all women worldwide. At the moment, there are no effective techniques for preventing or curing breast cancer, as the source of the disease is unclear. Early diagnosis is a highly successful means of detecting and managing breast cancer, and early identification may result in a greater likelihood of complete recovery. Mammography is the most effective method of detecting breast cancer early. Additionally, this instrument enables the detection of additional illnesses and may provide information about the nature of cancer, such as benign, malignant, or normal. This article discusses an evolutionary approach for classifying and detecting breast cancer that is based on machine learning and image processing. This model combines image preprocessing, feature extraction, feature selection, and machine learning techniques to aid in the classification and identification of skin diseases. To enhance the image\u2019s quality, a geometric mean filter is used. AlexNet is used for extracting features. Feature selection is performed using the relief algorithm. For disease categorization and detection, the model makes use of the machine learning techniques such as least square support vector machine, KNN, random forest, and Na\u00efve Bayes. The experimental investigation makes use of MIAS data collection. This proposed technology is advantageous for accurately identifying breast cancer disease using image analysis.",

    "abstract": "The collection and curation of large-scale medical datasets from multiple institutions is essential for training accurate deep learning models, but privacy concerns often hinder data sharing. Federated learning (FL) is a promising solution that enables privacy-preserving collaborative learning among different institutions, but it generally suffers from performance deterioration due to heterogeneous data distributions and a lack of quality labeled data. In this paper, we present a robust and label-efficient self-supervised FL framework for medical image analysis. Our method introduces a novel Transformer-based self-supervised pre-training paradigm that pre-trains models directly on decentralized target task datasets using masked image modeling, to facilitate more robust representation learning on heterogeneous data and effective knowledge transfer to downstream models. Extensive empirical results on simulated and real-world medical imaging non-IID federated datasets show that masked image modeling with Transformers significantly improves the robustness of models against various degrees of data heterogeneity. Notably, under severe data heterogeneity, our method, without relying on any additional pre-training data, achieves an improvement of 5.06%, 1.53% and 4.58% in test accuracy on retinal, dermatology and chest X-ray classification compared to the supervised baseline with ImageNet pre-training. In addition, we show that our federated self-supervised pre-training methods yield models that generalize better to out-of-distribution data and perform more effectively when fine-tuning with limited labeled data, compared to existing FL algorithms.

    "abstract": "The aim of this study is to evaluate infected leaf disease images. Precision agriculture's automatic leaf disease detection system employs image acquisition, image processing, image segmentation, feature extraction, and machine learning techniques. An automated disease detection system offers the farmer with a fast and accurate diagnosis of the plant disease. Automation of plant leaf disease detection system is essential for accelerating crop diagnosis. Using machine learning and image processing, this paper describes a framework for detecting leaf illness. An image of a leaf can be used as an input for this framework. To begin, leaf photographs are preprocessed in order to remove noise from their images. The mean filter is used to filter out background noise. Histogram equalization is used to enhance the quality of the image. The division of a single image into multiple portions or segments is referred to as segmentation in photography. It assists in establishing the boundaries of the image. Segmenting the image is accomplished using the K-Means approach. Feature extraction is carried by using the principal component analysis. Following that, images are categorized using techniques such as RBF-SVM, SVM, random forest, and ID3.",

    "abstract": "The article examines and analyzes the linguistic and psychological features of political discourse using a computer-based Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) content analysis program to explore the relationship between political discourse and the personality of politicians. As for political discourse, it is perhaps the communicator, the linguistic personality, who plays the most important role in the communication. The linguistic personality of a politician is of particular interest in political discourse content-analysis, since it has the greatest influence on the public consciousness via mass media. Using text as a source of psychological and cognitive information has been gaining popularity. Researchers use a variety of methods to analyze texts, but Linguistic Inquiry Word Count (LIWC) has proved to be the most common technique. The analysis of linguistic patterns of political discourse shows that in the context of political speech events such as media interviews, politicians make a unique choice of lexical units, which can be interpreted as a manifestation of certain personality traits. However, despite the significance of the results, there are clear limitations to the use of computerized methodologies to make political discourse content-analysis, such as the limited interpretive capacity of software to understand pragmatic and contextual use of lexical units.",

    "abstract": "We find a consistent, unified narrative structure that can be reliably quantified using modern text analysis methods. Scholars across disciplines have long debated the existence of a common structure that underlies narratives. Using computer-based language analysis methods, several structural and psychological categories of language were measured across ~40,000 traditional narratives (e.g., novels and movie scripts) and ~20,000 nontraditional narratives (science reporting in newspaper articles, TED talks, and Supreme Court opinions). Across traditional narratives, a consistent underlying story structure emerged that revealed three primary processes: staging, plot progression, and cognitive tension. No evidence emerged to indicate that adherence to normative story structures was related to the popularity of the story. Last, analysis of fact-driven texts revealed structures that differed from story-based narratives.",

    "abstract": "Technology now makes it possible to understand efficiently and at large scale how people use language to reveal their everyday thoughts, behaviors, and emotions. Written text has been analyzed through both theory-based, closed-vocabulary methods from the social sciences as well as data-driven, open-vocabulary methods from computer science, but these approaches have not been comprehensively compared. To provide guidance on best practices for automatically analyzing written text, this narrative review and quantitative synthesis compares five predominant closed- and open-vocabulary methods: Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC), the General Inquirer, DICTION, Latent Dirichlet Allocation, and Differential Language Analysis. We compare the linguistic features associated with gender, age, and personality across the five methods using an existing dataset of Facebook status updates and self-reported survey data from 65,896 users. Results are fairly consistent across methods. The closed-vocabulary approaches efficiently summarize concepts and are helpful for understanding how people think, with LIWC2015 yielding the strongest, most parsimonious results. Open-vocabulary approaches reveal more specific and concrete patterns across a broad range of content domains, better address ambiguous word senses, and are less prone to misinterpretation, suggesting that they are well-suited for capturing the nuances of everyday psychological processes. We detail several errors that can occur in closed-vocabulary analyses, the impact of sample size, number of words per user and number of topics included in open-vocabulary analyses, and implications of different analytical decisions. We conclude with recommendations for researchers, advocating for a complementary approach that combines closed- and open-vocabulary methods.

    "title": "Latent Semantic Scaling: A Semisupervised Text Analysis Technique for New Domains and Languages",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Many social scientists recognize that quantitative text analysis is a useful research methodology, but its application is still concentrated in documents written in European languages, especially English, and few sub-fields of political science, such as comparative politics and legislative studies. This seems to be due to the absence of flexible and cost-efficient methods that can be used to analyze documents in different domains and languages. Aiming to solve this problem, this paper proposes a semisupervised document scaling technique, called Latent Semantic Scaling (LSS), which can locate documents on various pre-defined dimensions. LSS achieves this by combining user-provided seed words and latent semantic analysis (word embedding). The article demonstrates its flexibility and efficiency in large-scale sentiment analysis of New York Times articles on the economy and Asahi Shimbun articles on politics. These examples show that LSS can produce results comparable to that of the Lexicoder Sentiment Dictionary (LSD) in both English and Japanese with only small sets of sentiment seed words. A new heuristic method that assists LSS users to choose a near-optimal number of singular values to obtain word vectors that best capture differences between documents on target dimensions is also presented.",

The task is to highlight salient portions of a contract that are important for a human to review. We find that Transformer models have nascent performance, but that this performance is strongly influenced by model design and training dataset size.

To instantiate different seen/unseen task partitions in CrossFit and facilitate in-depth analysis, we present the NLP Few-shot Gym, a repository of 160 diverse few-shot NLP tasks created from open-access NLP datasets and converted to a unified text-to-text format. Our analysis reveals that the few-shot learning ability on unseen tasks can be improved via an upstream learning stage using a set of seen tasks. We also observe that the selection of upstream learning tasks can significantly influence few-shot performance on unseen tasks, asking further analysis on task similarity and transferability.",

For instance, we insert 50 poison examples into a sentiment model\u2019s training set that causes the model to frequently predict Positive whenever the input contains \u201cJames Bond\u201d. Crucially, we craft these poison examples using a gradient-based procedure so that they do not mention the trigger phrase. We also apply our poison attack to language modeling (\u201cApple iPhone\u201d triggers negative generations) and machine translation (\u201ciced coffee\u201d mistranslated as \u201chot coffee\u201d). We conclude by proposing three defenses that can mitigate our attack at some cost in prediction accuracy or extra human annotation.",

    "abstract": "Much of the recent progress in sequential and session-based recommendation has been driven by improvements in model architecture and pretraining techniques originating in the field of Natural Language Processing. Transformer architectures in particular have facilitated building higher-capacity models and provided data augmentation and training techniques which demonstrably improve the effectiveness of sequential recommendation. But with a thousandfold more research going on in NLP, the application of transformers for recommendation understandably lags behind. To remedy this we introduce Transformers4Rec, an open-source library built upon HuggingFace\u2019s Transformers library with a similar goal of opening up the advances of NLP based Transformers to the recommender system community and making these advancements immediately accessible for the tasks of sequential and session-based recommendation. Like its core dependency, Transformers4Rec is designed to be extensible by researchers, simple for practitioners, and fast and robust in industrial deployments. In order to demonstrate the usefulness of the library and the applicability of Transformer architectures in next-click prediction for user sessions, where sequence lengths are much shorter than those commonly found in NLP, we have leveraged Transformers4Rec to win two recent session-based recommendation competitions. In addition, we present in this paper the first comprehensive empirical analysis comparing many Transformer architectures and training approaches for the task of session-based recommendation. We demonstrate that the best Transformer architectures have superior performance across two e-commerce datasets while performing similarly to the baselines on two news datasets. We further evaluate in isolation the effectiveness of the different training techniques used in causal language modeling, masked language modeling, permutation language modeling and replacement token detection for a single Transformer architecture, XLNet. We establish that training XLNet with replacement token detection performs well across all datasets. Finally, we explore techniques to include side information such as item and user context features in order to establish best practices and show that the inclusion of side information uniformly improves recommendation performance.

    "abstract": "Abstract Emotional recognition has arisen as an essential field of study that can expose a variety of valuable inputs. Emotion can be articulated in several means that can be seen, like speech and facial expressions, written text, and gestures. Emotion recognition in a text document is fundamentally a content-based classification issue, including notions from natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning fields. Hence, in this study, deep learning assisted semantic text analysis (DLSTA) has been proposed for human emotion detection using big data. Emotion detection from textual sources can be done utilizing notions of Natural Language Processing. Word embeddings are extensively utilized for several NLP tasks, like machine translation, sentiment analysis, and question answering. NLP techniques improve the performance of learning-based methods by incorporating the semantic and syntactic features of the text. The numerical outcomes demonstrate that the suggested method achieves an expressively superior quality of human emotion detection rate of 97.22% and the classification accuracy rate of 98.02% with different state-of-the-art methods and can be enhanced by other emotional word embeddings.",

    "title": "Depression Detection from Social Media Text Analysis using Natural Language Processing Techniques and Hybrid Deep Learning Model",
    "abstract": "Depression is a kind of emotion that negatively impacts people's daily lives. The number of people suffering from long-term feelings is increasing every year across the globe. Depressed patients may engage in self-harm behaviors, which occasionally result in suicide. Many psychiatrists struggle to identify the presence of mental illness or negative emotion early to provide a better course of treatment before they reach a critical stage. One of the most challenging problems is detecting depression in people at the earliest possible stage. Researchers are using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze text content uploaded on social media, which helps to design approaches for detecting depression. This work analyses numerous prior studies that used learning techniques to identify depression. The existing methods suffer from better model representation problems to detect depression from the text with high accuracy. The present work addresses a solution to these problems by creating a new hybrid deep learning neural network design with better text representations called \u201cFasttext Convolution Neural Network with Long Short-Term Memory (FCL).\u201d In addition, this work utilizes the advantage of NLP to simplify the text analysis during the model development. The FCL model comprises fasttext embedding for better text representation considering out-of-vocabulary (OOV) with semantic information, a convolution neural network (CNN) architecture to extract global information, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture to extract local features with dependencies. The present work was implemented on real-world datasets utilized in the literature. The proposed technique provides better results than the state-of-the-art to detect depression with high accuracy.",

    "title": "Sentiment is Not Stance: Target-Aware Opinion Classification for Political Text Analysis",
    "abstract": "Abstract Sentiment analysis techniques have a long history in natural language processing and have become a standard tool in the analysis of political texts, promising a conceptually straightforward automated method of extracting meaning from textual data by scoring documents on a scale from positive to negative. However, while these kinds of sentiment scores can capture the overall tone of a document, the underlying concept of interest for political analysis is often actually the document\u2019s stance with respect to a given target\u2014how positively or negatively it frames a specific idea, individual, or group\u2014as this reflects the author\u2019s underlying political attitudes. In this paper, we question the validity of approximating author stance through sentiment scoring in the analysis of political texts, and advocate for greater attention to be paid to the conceptual distinction between a document\u2019s sentiment and its stance. Using examples from open-ended survey responses and from political discussions on social media, we demonstrate that in many political text analysis applications, sentiment and stance do not necessarily align, and therefore sentiment analysis methods fail to reliably capture ground-truth document stance, amplifying noise in the data and leading to faulty conclusions.",

    "title": "Sentiment Analysis and Text Analysis of the Public Discourse on Twitter about COVID-19 and MPox",
    "abstract": "Mining and analysis of the big data of Twitter conversations have been of significant interest to the scientific community in the fields of healthcare, epidemiology, big data, data science, computer science, and their related areas, as can be seen from several works in the last few years that focused on sentiment analysis and other forms of text analysis of tweets related to Ebola, E-Coli, Dengue, Human Papillomavirus (HPV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), Measles, Zika virus, H1N1, influenza-like illness, swine flu, flu, Cholera, Listeriosis, cancer, Liver Disease, Inflammatory Bowel Disease, kidney disease, lupus, Parkinson\u2019s, Diphtheria, and West Nile virus. The recent outbreaks of COVID-19 and MPox have served as \u201ccatalysts\u201d for Twitter usage related to seeking and sharing information, views, opinions, and sentiments involving both of these viruses. None of the prior works in this field analyzed tweets focusing on both COVID-19 and MPox simultaneously. To address this research gap, a total of 61,862 tweets that focused on MPox and COVID-19 simultaneously, posted between 7 May 2022 and 3 March 2023, were studied. The findings and contributions of this study are manifold. First, the results of sentiment analysis using the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary for sEntiment Reasoning) approach shows that nearly half the tweets (46.88%) had a negative sentiment. It was followed by tweets that had a positive sentiment (31.97%) and tweets that had a neutral sentiment (21.14%), respectively. Second, this paper presents the top 50 hashtags used in these tweets. Third, it presents the top 100 most frequently used words in these tweets after performing tokenization, removal of stopwords, and word frequency analysis. The findings indicate that tweets in this context included a high level of interest regarding COVID-19, MPox and other viruses, President Biden, and Ukraine. Finally, a comprehensive comparative study that compares the contributions of this paper with 49 prior works in this field is presented to further uphold the relevance and novelty of this work.",

    "title": "Detection of emotion by text analysis using machine learning",
    "abstract": "Emotions are an integral part of human life. We know many different definitions of emotions. They are most often defined as a complex pattern of reactions, and they could be confused with feelings or moods. They are the way in which individuals cope with matters or situations that they find personally significant. Emotion can also be characterized as a conscious mental reaction (such as anger or fear) subjectively experienced as a strong feeling, usually directed at a specific object. Emotions can be communicated in different ways. Understanding the emotions conveyed in a text or speech of a human by a machine is one of the challenges in the field of human-machine interaction. The article proposes the artificial intelligence approach to automatically detect human emotions, enabling a machine (i.e., a chatbot) to accurately assess emotional state of a human and to adapt its communication accordingly. A complete automation of this process is still a problem. This gap can be filled with machine learning approaches based on automatic learning from experiences represented by the text data from conversations. We conducted experiments with a lexicon-based approach and classic methods of machine learning, appropriate for text processing, such as Na\u00efve Bayes (NB), support vector machine (SVM) and with deep learning using neural networks (NN) to develop a model for detecting emotions in a text. We have compared these models\u2019 effectiveness. The NN detection model performed particularly well in a multi-classification task involving six emotions from the text data. It achieved an F1-score\u2009=\u20090.95 for sadness, among other high scores for other emotions. We also verified the best model in use through a web application and in a Chatbot communication with a human. We created a web application based on our detection model that can analyze a text input by web user and detect emotions expressed in a text of a post or a comment. The model for emotions detection was used also to improve the communication of the Chatbot with a human since the Chatbot has the information about emotional state of a human during communication. Our research demonstrates the potential of machine learning approaches to detect emotions from a text and improve human-machine interaction. However, it is important to note that full automation of an emotion detection is still an open research question, and further work is needed to improve the accuracy and robustness of this system. The paper also offers the description of new aspects of automated detection of emotions from philosophy-psychological point of view.",

    "abstract": "Introduction In recent years, research has used psycholinguistic features in public discourse, networking behaviors on social media and profile information to train models for depression detection. However, the most widely adopted approach for the extraction of psycholinguistic features is to use the Linguistic Inquiry Word Count (LIWC) dictionary and various affective lexicons. Other features related to cultural factors and suicide risk have not been explored. Moreover, the use of social networking behavioral features and profile features would limit the generalizability of the model. Therefore, our study aimed at building a prediction model of depression for text-only social media data through a wider range of possible linguistic features related to depression, and illuminate the relationship between linguistic expression and depression. Methods We collected 789 users\u2019 depression scores as well as their past posts on Weibo, and extracted a total of 117 lexical features via Simplified Chinese Linguistic Inquiry Word Count, Chinese Suicide Dictionary, Chinese Version of Moral Foundations Dictionary, Chinese Version of Moral Motivation Dictionary, and Chinese Individualism/Collectivism Dictionary. Results Results showed that all the dictionaries contributed to the prediction. The best performing model occurred with linear regression, with the Pearson correlation coefficient between predicted values and self-reported values was 0.33, the R-squared was 0.10, and the split-half reliability was 0.75. Discussion This study did not only develop a predictive model applicable to text-only social media data, but also demonstrated the importance taking cultural psychological factors and suicide related expressions into consideration in the calculation of word frequency. Our research provided a more comprehensive understanding of how lexicons related to cultural psychology and suicide risk were associated with depression, and could contribute to the recognition of depression.",

    "abstract": "Public sector institutions that consult citizens to inform decision-making face the challenge of evaluating the contributions made by citizens. This evaluation has important democratic implications but at the same time, consumes substantial human resources. However, until now the use of artificial intelligence such as computer-supported text analysis has remained an under-studied solution to this problem. We identify three generic tasks in the evaluation process that could benefit from natural language processing (NLP). Based on a systematic literature search in two databases on computational linguistics and digital government, we provide a detailed review of existing methods and their performance. While some promising approaches exist, for instance to group data thematically and to detect arguments and opinions, we show that there remain important challenges before these could offer any reliable support in practice. These include the quality of results, the applicability to non-English language corpuses and making algorithmic models available to practitioners through software. We discuss a number of avenues that future research should pursue that can ultimately lead to solutions for practice. The most promising of these bring in the expertise of human evaluators, for example through active learning approaches or interactive topic modeling.",

    "abstract": "Trading off exploration and exploitation in an unknown environment is key to maximising expected return during learning. A Bayes-optimal policy, which does so optimally, conditions its actions not only on the environment state but on the agent's uncertainty about the environment. Computing a Bayes-optimal policy is however intractable for all but the smallest tasks. In this paper, we introduce variational Bayes-Adaptive Deep RL (variBAD), a way to meta-learn to perform approximate inference in an unknown environment, and incorporate task uncertainty directly during action selection. In a grid-world domain, we illustrate how variBAD performs structured online exploration as a function of task uncertainty. We further evaluate variBAD on MuJoCo domains widely used in meta-RL and show that it achieves higher online return than existing methods.",

    "abstract": "We present RL-GAN-Net, where a reinforcement learning (RL) agent provides fast and robust control of a generative adversarial network (GAN). Our framework is applied to point cloud shape completion that converts noisy, partial point cloud data into a high-fidelity completed shape by controlling the GAN. While a GAN is unstable and hard to train, we circumvent the problem by (1) training the GAN on the latent space representation whose dimension is reduced compared to the raw point cloud input and (2) using an RL agent to find the correct input to the GAN to generate the latent space representation of the shape that best fits the current input of incomplete point cloud. The suggested pipeline robustly completes point cloud with large missing regions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to train an RL agent to control the GAN, which effectively learns the highly nonlinear mapping from the input noise of the GAN to the latent space of point cloud. The RL agent replaces the need for complex optimization and consequently makes our technique real time. Additionally, we demonstrate that our pipelines can be used to enhance the classification accuracy of point cloud with missing data.",

    "abstract": "The construction by Du et al. (2019) implies that even if a learner is given linear features in $\\mathbb R^d$ that approximate the rewards in a bandit with a uniform error of $\\epsilon$, then searching for an action that is optimal up to $O(\\epsilon)$ requires examining essentially all actions. We use the Kiefer-Wolfowitz theorem to prove a positive result that by checking only a few actions, a learner can always find an action that is suboptimal with an error of at most $O(\\epsilon \\sqrt{d})$. Thus, features are useful when the approximation error is small relative to the dimensionality of the features. The idea is applied to stochastic bandits and reinforcement learning with a generative model where the learner has access to $d$-dimensional linear features that approximate the action-value functions for all policies to an accuracy of $\\epsilon$. For linear bandits, we prove a bound on the regret of order $\\sqrt{dn \\log(k)} + \\epsilon n \\sqrt{d} \\log(n)$ with $k$ the number of actions and $n$ the horizon. For RL we show that approximate policy iteration can learn a policy that is optimal up to an additive error of order $\\epsilon \\sqrt{d}/(1 - \\gamma)^2$ and using $d/(\\epsilon^2(1 - \\gamma)^4)$ samples from a generative model. These bounds are independent of the finer details of the features. We also investigate how the structure of the feature set impacts the tradeoff between sample complexity and estimation error.",

    "abstract": "The lottery ticket hypothesis proposes that over-parameterization of deep neural networks (DNNs) aids training by increasing the probability of a \"lucky\" sub-network initialization being present rather than by helping the optimization process (Frankle & Carbin, 2019). Intriguingly, this phenomenon suggests that initialization strategies for DNNs can be improved substantially, but the lottery ticket hypothesis has only previously been tested in the context of supervised learning for natural image tasks. Here, we evaluate whether \"winning ticket\" initializations exist in two different domains: natural language processing (NLP) and reinforcement learning (RL).For NLP, we examined both recurrent LSTM models and large-scale Transformer models (Vaswani et al., 2017). For RL, we analyzed a number of discrete-action space tasks, including both classic control and pixel control. Consistent with workin supervised image classification, we confirm that winning ticket initializations generally outperform parameter-matched random initializations, even at extreme pruning rates for both NLP and RL. Notably, we are able to find winning ticket initializations for Transformers which enable models one-third the size to achieve nearly equivalent performance. Together, these results suggest that the lottery ticket hypothesis is not restricted to supervised learning of natural images, but rather represents a broader phenomenon in DNNs.",
