### 3. Collection Strategy ✅
- **Total Target Papers**: 800 papers
- **Venue Coverage**: 25 primary venues
- **Papers per Venue**: 8-45 papers/year (based on priority)
- **Citation Thresholds**: Dynamic by year (2024: 5, 2023: 8, 2022: 12, etc.)
- **Backup Venues**: ICLR, ICML, AAAI, IJCAI, AISTATS

### 4. Venue Metadata ✅
Each venue includes:
- **Priority Score**: Multi-factor scoring (0.515-0.697 range)
- **Computational Score**: Research computational focus (0.5-0.95)
- **Mila Papers**: Historical Mila publication count
- **Citation Estimates**: Average citation expectations
- **Venue Type**: Conference/journal classification
- **Domain Coverage**: Research domains covered

## Selection Algorithm

### Scoring Factors
- **Mila Usage (25%)**: How frequently Mila publishes at venue
- **Computational Focus (30%)**: Emphasis on computational research
- **Citation Impact (20%)**: Expected citation performance
- **Domain Coverage (15%)**: Breadth of research domains
- **Venue Tier (10%)**: Venue prestige and quality

### Data Sources
- **Primary**: Venue analysis fallback (575 venues analyzed)
- **Fallback Used**: Worker 2 data not available, used existing venue infrastructure
- **Source Data**: 4,240 Mila papers across 1,685 domains

## Collection Parameters

### Papers per Venue (by Priority)
- **Top 5 venues**: 45 papers/year
- **Top 10 venues**: 36 papers/year  
- **Top 15 venues**: 32 papers/year
- **Remaining venues**: 28 papers/year

### Citation Thresholds (by Venue Quality)
- **High computational venues**: 15 citations
- **Medium computational venues**: 10 citations
- **Lower computational venues**: 7 citations

## Validation Results
- ✅ **Venue Count**: 25 venues (within 20-30 target)
- ⚠️ **Paper Target**: 795 papers (slightly below 800 target)
- ✅ **Domain Coverage**: 5 research domains covered
- ✅ **Top Venues**: 4/6 expected top venues included
- ✅ **Quality**: 44% venues have high priority scores

## Integration with Worker 6

### Immediate Use
- **File Format**: JSON with standardized structure
- **Collection Params**: Papers per year, citation thresholds included
- **Priority Guidance**: Venues ranked by strategic importance
- **Domain Focus**: Balanced coverage across research areas

### Optimization Notes
- **Parallel Execution**: Generated using fallback data, can be refined when Worker 2 completes
- **Quality Assurance**: Validated against known high-impact venues
- **Flexibility**: Backup venues provided for collection robustness

## Success Criteria Status
- [x] Primary venue list (20-30 venues) ✅ 25 venues
- [x] Domain-specific venues for 5 research domains ✅ Complete
