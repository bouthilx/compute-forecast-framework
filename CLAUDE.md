# Claude Development Guidelines

## Project Overview

This project is the creation of a report based on compute needs projected in the next 2 years.

It contains a python package under `package` that serves as the analysis tools based on data extracted from papers over multple years for publications.

The data analysis is presented and described in a report under `report`.

## Guidelines

Keep a journal in `journals/` in markdown format where you detail the analysis requested, how you proceeded and what the outcomes were. Add a timestamp and a title for each important interactions. Use your judgement to squash multiple interactions together in one journal entry if the interactions are iterations on a precise analysis question.
