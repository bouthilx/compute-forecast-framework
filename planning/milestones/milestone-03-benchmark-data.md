# Milestone 3: Benchmark Data Extracted

## Objective
Extract computational requirements from all selected academic and industry benchmark papers using the established pipeline.

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Academic benchmark computational requirements extracted (2019-2024)
- ✅ Industry benchmark computational requirements extracted (2019-2024)
- ✅ Initial data quality validation completed
- ✅ >80% of selected papers have extractable computational data

## Detailed Tasks

### Academic Benchmark Extraction
- **Process all academic benchmark papers** (36-72 papers)
- **Extract core computational metrics**:
  - Training compute requirements
  - Hardware specifications used
  - Experimental scale and methodology
  - Additional computational overhead (hyperparameter search, ablations)

- **Quality assessment per paper**:
  - High confidence: Explicit computational details
  - Medium confidence: Partial information with reasonable inference
  - Low confidence: Minimal information requiring significant estimation

### Industry Benchmark Extraction
- **Process all industry benchmark papers** (36-72 papers)
- **Focus on breakthrough computational requirements**:
  - Large-scale training specifications
  - Infrastructure requirements
  - Novel computational approaches
  - Resource scaling demonstrations

- **Industry-specific considerations**:
  - Often higher computational scales than academic papers
  - More detailed infrastructure documentation
  - Breakthrough methodology computational costs

### Data Organization and Normalization
- **Temporal organization**: Data structured by year (2019-2024) and domain
- **Hardware normalization**: All metrics converted to A100-equivalent units
- **Standardization**: Consistent units and formatting across all extractions
- **Metadata tracking**: Paper source, confidence level, extraction date

### Initial Quality Validation
- **Extraction success rate analysis**:
  - Percentage of papers with extractable data by domain and year
  - Identification of data gaps and limitations
  - Quality distribution assessment

- **Cross-validation checks**:
  - Spot-check manual extraction against automated results
  - Verify normalization calculations
  - Identify and investigate outliers

## Deliverables
1. **Academic benchmark dataset**: Computational requirements for all academic papers (2019-2024)
2. **Industry benchmark dataset**: Computational requirements for all industry papers (2019-2024)
3. **Data quality report**: Extraction success rates, confidence levels, identified limitations
4. **Normalized dataset**: All data in standardized A100-equivalent units
5. **Extraction log**: Detailed record of extraction process and decisions

## Quality Checks
- **Extraction completeness**: >80% success rate target met
- **Data consistency**: Standardized units and formatting verified
- **Temporal coverage**: Reasonable distribution across years for trend analysis
- **Domain representation**: All major domains have sufficient data points

## Risk Mitigation
- **Low extraction success**: Focus on papers with best computational documentation
- **Data quality issues**: Implement confidence scoring and quality flags
- **Temporal gaps**: Acknowledge limitations and adjust analysis scope
- **Normalization errors**: Cross-validate conversion calculations

## Critical Decision Points
- **If <60% extraction success**: Consider reducing paper scope or adjusting methodology
- **If major data gaps**: Document limitations and adjust analysis expectations
- **If normalization issues**: Revise framework or acknowledge uncertainty

## Dependencies
- Completed paper selection (Milestone 1)
- Established extraction pipeline (Milestone 2)
- Access to selected benchmark papers

## Timeline
- **Duration**: 1 day
- **Completion criteria**: Complete benchmark datasets ready for temporal analysis
