# Milestone 7: Trajectory Comparison Complete

## Objective
Analyze and compare growth trajectories across all three datasets to determine Mila's competitive positioning and trend direction.

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Three-way growth rate comparison (Mila vs. academic vs. industry)
- ✅ Relative positioning analysis (catching up/keeping pace/falling behind)
- ✅ Domain-specific competitive positioning assessment
- ✅ Clear narrative on Mila's competitive trajectory

## Detailed Tasks

### Growth Rate Comparative Analysis
