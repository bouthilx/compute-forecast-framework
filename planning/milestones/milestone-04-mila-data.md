# Milestone 4: Mila Data Extracted

## Objective
Extract computational requirements from Mila paper corpus (2019-2024) using the same methodology as benchmark papers for valid comparison.

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Mila paper computational requirements extracted (2019-2024)
- ✅ Domain classification and temporal organization complete
- ✅ Cross-validation with benchmark extraction methodology
- ✅ >60% of Mila papers have extractable computational data

## Detailed Tasks

### Mila Paper Processing
- **Systematic extraction** from complete Mila corpus (2019-2024)
- **Same extraction template** as used for benchmark papers
- **Focus on papers with computational sections**:
  - Methodology sections with training details
  - Experimental sections with resource specifications
  - Acknowledgments mentioning compute grants/resources

### Domain Classification
- **Categorize Mila papers by research domain**:
  - NLP/LLM: Natural language processing, large language models
  - Computer Vision: Image processing, generation, analysis
  - Reinforcement Learning: Policy learning, game playing, robotics
  - Multimodal: Cross-modal AI, vision-language models
  - Audio/Speech: Speech recognition, synthesis, audio processing
  - ML Theory: Theoretical machine learning, optimization
  - Other: Emerging areas or cross-domain research

### Temporal Organization
- **Year-by-year structure** (2019-2024) for trend analysis
- **Track research evolution** within domains over time
- **Identify paradigm shifts** in Mila's computational approaches
- **Document research growth** and scaling patterns

### Constraint Evidence Documentation
- **Identify resource limitation indicators**:
  - Papers mentioning computational constraints
  - Reduced experimental scope due to resource limits
  - Acknowledgments of computational support/limitations
  - Methodology choices influenced by resource availability

### Data Quality Assessment
- **Extraction success analysis**:
  - Success rate by domain and year
  - Quality distribution of extracted data
  - Comparison with benchmark extraction success

- **Constraint bias evaluation**:
  - Evidence of resource-constrained research
  - Comparison of reported vs. likely optimal computational needs
  - Identification of underestimated requirements

## Deliverables
1. **Mila computational dataset**: Extracted requirements organized by domain and year
2. **Domain classification**: Complete categorization of Mila papers
3. **Constraint evidence report**: Documentation of resource limitation indicators
4. **Extraction quality analysis**: Success rates and data quality assessment
5. **Comparative validation**: Cross-check with benchmark extraction methodology

## Quality Checks
- **Extraction consistency**: Same methodology applied as for benchmark papers
- **Domain coverage**: All major Mila research areas represented
- **Temporal completeness**: Sufficient data across 2019-2024 for trend analysis
- **Constraint documentation**: Clear evidence of resource limitations where present

## Risk Mitigation
- **Lower success rate expected**: Mila papers may have less computational documentation than high-impact benchmarks
- **Constraint bias**: Acknowledge that Mila data represents constrained rather than optimal computational needs
- **Domain imbalances**: Document any areas with insufficient data
- **Quality variations**: Use confidence scoring to weight analysis appropriately

## Critical Insights to Capture
- **Research evolution patterns**: How Mila's computational approaches have changed
- **Constraint indicators**: Evidence of resource limitations affecting research
- **Domain-specific trends**: Which areas show computational growth vs. stagnation
- **Comparative positioning**: How Mila research compares to benchmark standards

## Dependencies
- Completed benchmark data extraction (Milestone 3)
- Established extraction pipeline (Milestone 2)
- Access to complete Mila paper corpus

## Timeline
- **Duration**: 1 day
- **Completion criteria**: Complete Mila dataset ready for gap analysis and trend comparison
