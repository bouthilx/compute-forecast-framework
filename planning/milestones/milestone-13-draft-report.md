### Executive Summary Writing
- **Opening statement**:
  - Mila's current competitive position relative to academic and industry benchmarks
  - Trajectory analysis showing whether Mila is catching up, keeping pace, or falling behind
  - Timeline urgency for strategic intervention

- **Key findings summary**:
  - Academic competitiveness gaps and requirements
  - Innovation opportunity identification and potential
  - Domain-specific priorities and investment needs
  - Strategic scenarios and their implications

- **Strategic recommendations**:
  - Immediate intervention needs for academic survival
  - Medium-term investment for competitive positioning
  - Long-term strategic investment for innovation leadership
  - Implementation timeline and resource deployment plan

### Main Analysis Section Writing
- **Current Position Analysis**:
  - Quantified gaps between Mila and academic benchmarks
  - Quantified gaps between Mila and industry benchmarks
  - Domain-specific competitive positioning assessment
  - Evidence of computational constraints in current research

- **Trajectory Analysis**:
  - Three-way growth rate comparison (Mila vs. academic vs. industry)
  - Gap evolution patterns (widening/narrowing/stable)
  - Competitive positioning trend assessment
  - Strategic intervention opportunity identification

- **Projection Framework**:
  - Academic competitiveness scenario requirements and timeline
  - Innovation opportunity scenario requirements and potential
  - Conservative/competitive/leadership investment frameworks
  - Uncertainty assessment and risk analysis

- **Strategic Implementation**:
  - Resource allocation priorities by domain and timeline
  - Infrastructure requirements and deployment considerations
  - Success metrics and progress monitoring framework
  - Strategic milestone achievement timeline

### Methodology Appendix Development
- **Data Collection Methodology**:
  - Benchmark paper selection criteria and process
  - Mila paper corpus organization and analysis
  - Computational requirement extraction procedures
  - Quality control and validation processes

- **Analysis Framework**:
  - Hardware normalization methodology
  - Growth rate calculation and trend analysis
  - Gap quantification and projection methods
  - Statistical validation and uncertainty quantification

- **Assumptions and Limitations**:
  - Key assumptions underlying projections
  - Data quality limitations and their implications
  - Methodological limitations and uncertainty sources
  - Conservative interpretation and risk acknowledgment

### Visual Integration
- **Chart placement and integration**:
  - Temporal evolution charts supporting trajectory analysis
  - Gap analysis visualizations illustrating competitive positioning
  - Projection scenarios supporting strategic recommendations
  - Executive summary dashboard for high-level insights

- **Visual narrative flow**:
  - Charts support and enhance textual analysis
  - Logical progression from current position to future projections
  - Clear visual evidence for strategic recommendations
  - Professional presentation quality throughout

### Evidence Integration
- **Quantitative evidence presentation**:
  - Specific computational multipliers and gap measurements
  - Growth rate comparisons with statistical significance
  - Projection scenarios with confidence intervals
  - Resource requirement specifications with timelines

- **Qualitative evidence integration**:
  - Research constraint documentation from Mila papers
  - Competitive positioning assessment and implications
  - Strategic opportunity identification and potential impact
  - Implementation feasibility and deployment considerations

### Strategic Messaging Integration
- **Dual-tier defense framework**:
  - Academic survival messaging with urgency and evidence
  - Innovation opportunity messaging with potential and value
  - Clear distinction between minimum requirements and strategic advantage
  - Compelling case for both tiers of computational investment

- **Counter-argument preemption**:
  - Academic benchmark evidence addressing "do different research" objections
  - Conservative projections addressing "resource waste" concerns
  - Evidence-based approach addressing "unrealistic expectations" pushback
  - Strategic value proposition addressing "industry envy" criticism
