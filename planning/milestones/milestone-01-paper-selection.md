# Milestone 1: Paper Selection Complete

## Objective
Identify and organize all papers needed for the three-way temporal analysis (Mila, Academic Benchmarks, Industry Benchmarks).

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Academic benchmark papers selected (5-10 per domain per year, 2019-2024)
- ✅ Industry benchmark papers selected (5-10 per domain per year, 2019-2024)
- ✅ Mila paper corpus organized by domain and year (2019-2024)
- ✅ Total: 360-720 benchmark papers + complete Mila corpus access
- ✅ Citation data verified for ALL selected papers

## Detailed Tasks

### Academic Benchmark Paper Selection
- **Target**: 5-10 papers per domain per year (2019-2024)
- **Domain identification**: Based on Mila's publication patterns and research focus areas
- **Venue identification**: Conferences where Mila researchers publish (extracted from corpus analysis)
- **Selection criteria**:
  - Top-cited academic papers in Mila-relevant venues (majority academic authors)
  - Author affiliation filter: <25% industry authors allowed (collaborative research acceptable)
  - Citation data REQUIRED - no papers without verifiable citation counts
  - Computational transparency (papers with documented compute requirements)
- **Expected output**: 180-360 academic benchmark papers

### Industry Benchmark Paper Selection
- **Target**: 5-10 breakthrough papers per domain per year (2019-2024)
- **Domain focus**: Same domains as identified from Mila publication analysis
- **Selection criteria**:
  - Breakthrough methodologies from major industry labs
  - Citation data REQUIRED - high-impact papers with verifiable metrics
  - Computational requirements documented in papers
  - Papers that influence research directions in Mila's domains
- **Expected output**: 180-360 industry benchmark papers

### Mila Paper Corpus Organization
- **Source**: Complete Mila publication dataset (2019-2024)
- **Organization**: By domain and year for temporal analysis
- **Filtering**: Focus on papers with potential computational information
- **Validation**: Verify corpus completeness and domain coverage

## Deliverables
1. **Academic benchmark paper list**: Organized by domain and year with citation info
2. **Industry benchmark paper list**: Organized by domain and year with computational relevance notes
3. **Mila paper corpus**: Organized dataset ready for computational extraction
4. **Selection rationale**: Documentation of selection criteria and process

## Quality Checks
- **Domain coverage**: All major Mila research areas represented
- **Temporal balance**: Reasonable distribution across 2019-2024
- **Computational relevance**: Papers likely to contain extractable computational data
- **Citation validation**: Academic papers meet citation threshold criteria

## Risk Mitigation
- **Insufficient papers**: Have backup selection criteria for domains with limited options
- **Missing computational data**: Prepare manual extraction focus for critical papers
- **Domain imbalance**: Document limitations and adjust analysis accordingly

## Dependencies
- Access to Mila paper corpus
- Citation databases for academic benchmark selection
- Industry paper databases and archives

## Timeline
- **Duration**: 1 day
- **Completion criteria**: All paper lists finalized and ready for extraction pipeline
