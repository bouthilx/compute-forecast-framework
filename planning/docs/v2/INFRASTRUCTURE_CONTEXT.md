# Infrastructure Context - Data Collection Needed

## Major Infrastructure Changes Timeline
*To be filled with historical data*

### Cluster Upgrades
- [ ] Date and specifications of major cluster additions/upgrades
- [ ] GPU generations introduced (V100, A100, H100, etc.)
- [ ] Memory capacity changes
- [ ] Network/storage improvements

### Policy Changes
- [ ] Allocation policy modifications
- [ ] Queue system changes
- [ ] Resource limits adjustments
- [ ] Priority/preemption rule changes

### External Dependencies
- [ ] DRAC allocation changes
- [ ] Partnership compute resources
- [ ] Cloud integration timeline

## Impact Assessment
*To be analyzed once data is collected*

### Usage Pattern Shifts
- How infrastructure changes affected observable usage patterns
- Whether changes enabled new types of research vs. scaled existing work
- Correlation between infrastructure capacity and research output

### Constraint Evolution
- How resource constraints changed over time
- Identification of periods of high/low constraint pressure
- Impact on research methodology and experimental design
