# V2 Methodology - Core Limitations and Risk Analysis

## Primary Methodology: Pattern-Based Clustering of Usage Data

### CRITICAL LIMITATIONS

## 1. Constrained Data Problem
### **Limitation**: Usage data reflects constraints, not demand
- **Impact**: Severe underestimation of true computational needs
- **Scope**: Affects majority of research groups who are always resource-constrained
- **Evidence**: Researchers would use 10x more if available

### **Risk Level**: ðŸ”´ **CRITICAL**
- **Probability**: Very High (affects most data)
- **Impact**: Fundamental methodology failure - projections will be severely underestimated
- **Mitigation difficulty**: High - requires alternative data sources

---

## 2. Pattern Clustering Validity Issues
### **Limitation**: Patterns may reflect infrastructure constraints rather than research needs
- **Impact**: Clusters represent "how people work within constraints" not "how people want to work"
- **Example**: Small frequent jobs may indicate queue limits, not optimal research workflow
- **Consequence**: Extrapolating constrained patterns perpetuates underestimation

### **Risk Level**: ðŸ”´ **CRITICAL**
- **Probability**: High
- **Impact**: Projections based on artificial patterns, not research requirements
- **Mitigation difficulty**: High - requires understanding constraint mechanisms

---

## 3. Growth Rate Calculation Problems
### **Limitation**: Historical growth may reflect constraint relaxation, not demand growth
- **Impact**: Growth rates confound increased availability with increased demand
- **Example**: Usage doubles after infrastructure upgrade - is this pent-up demand or new requirements?
- **Temporal bias**: Recent data may be less constrained but still not unconstrained

### **Risk Level**: ðŸŸ¡ **HIGH**
- **Probability**: Medium-High
- **Impact**: Incorrect growth assumptions leading to projection errors
- **Mitigation difficulty**: Medium - requires infrastructure timeline analysis

---

## 4. External Benchmark Comparability
### **Limitation**: Other institutions may have different constraint levels
- **Impact**: Comparing constrained (Mila) with potentially less constrained (others) usage
- **Normalization problem**: How to adjust for different constraint environments
- **Data quality variance**: External data may have different collection methods

### **Risk Level**: ðŸŸ¡ **HIGH**
- **Probability**: Medium
- **Impact**: Misleading comparisons and validation
- **Mitigation difficulty**: Medium - requires understanding external constraint contexts

---

## 5. Domain-Specific Constraint Variation
### **Limitation**: Constraint levels vary dramatically across research domains
- **Impact**: Single methodology may not capture domain-specific realities
- **Examples**:
  - NLP/LLM: Always severely constrained
  - Theory: Possibly less constrained
  - Computer Vision: Highly variable
- **Risk**: Averaging across domains masks important differences

### **Risk Level**: ðŸŸ¡ **HIGH**
- **Probability**: High
- **Impact**: Domain-specific underestimation errors
- **Mitigation difficulty**: Medium - requires domain expertise

---

## SECONDARY LIMITATIONS

## 6. Co-authorship Analysis Limitations
### **Limitation**: Collaboration networks may not reflect computational similarity
- **Impact**: Merging groups with different computational needs
- **Risk**: Incorrect pattern assignment for merged groups

### **Risk Level**: ðŸŸ  **MEDIUM**
- **Probability**: Medium
- **Impact**: Localized errors in group assignments
- **Mitigation difficulty**: Low-Medium - can validate through usage comparison

---

## 7. Paper-Based Validation Challenges
### **Limitation**: Papers may not accurately report computational requirements
- **Under-reporting**: Not all compute usage documented
- **Over-reporting**: Theoretical vs. actual requirements
- **Inconsistent reporting**: Different standards across venues/authors

### **Risk Level**: ðŸŸ  **MEDIUM**
- **Probability**: Medium-High
- **Impact**: Validation data quality issues
- **Mitigation difficulty**: Medium - requires systematic extraction methodology

---

## 8. Temporal Coverage Gaps
### **Limitation**: Historical data may not cover recent research paradigm shifts
- **Impact**: Missing computational requirements for emerging research areas
- **Examples**: Large language models, multimodal AI, diffusion models
- **Consequence**: Underestimating growth in high-impact areas

### **Risk Level**: ðŸŸ  **MEDIUM**
- **Probability**: Medium
- **Impact**: Missing critical growth drivers
- **Mitigation difficulty**: Medium - requires recent data emphasis

## COMPOUND RISKS

## 9. Methodology Cascade Failure
### **Risk**: Multiple limitations compound to create systematic underestimation
- **Scenario**: Constrained data â†’ constrained patterns â†’ constrained growth rates â†’ severe underestimation
- **Amplification**: Each step in methodology inherits and amplifies constraint bias
- **Outcome**: Projections potentially off by order of magnitude

### **Risk Level**: ðŸ”´ **CRITICAL**
- **Probability**: High given individual limitation probabilities
- **Impact**: Complete methodology failure
- **Mitigation difficulty**: Very High - may require methodology pivot

---

## 10. Decision-Making Impact
### **Risk**: Underestimated projections lead to continued resource constraints
- **Consequence**: Perpetuates the problem we're trying to solve
- **Opportunity cost**: Missed research breakthroughs due to resource limitations
- **Credibility**: If projections prove too low, methodology credibility damaged

### **Risk Level**: ðŸ”´ **CRITICAL**
- **Probability**: High if limitations not addressed
- **Impact**: Strategic failure of the entire forecasting exercise
- **Mitigation difficulty**: High - requires getting projections right

---

## RISK MITIGATION STRATEGIES

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Acknowledge limitations explicitly** in all projections
2. **Develop constraint-adjustment multipliers** based on available evidence
3. **Integrate paper-based demand signals** as primary validation
4. **Create multiple scenarios** (current methodology + constraint-adjusted + paper-based)

### Methodology Pivot Considerations
- **Hybrid approach**: Combine usage patterns with paper-based requirement extraction
- **Constraint modeling**: Explicitly model constraint levels and adjust projections
- **Domain-specific methodologies**: Different approaches for different research areas
- **Expert elicitation**: Supplement data with domain expert input (limited scope)

## DECISION POINT: PIVOT OR PROCEED?
Given these limitations, we need to decide whether to:
1. **Proceed with explicit risk acknowledgment** and conservative interpretation
2. **Pivot to hybrid methodology** emphasizing paper-based analysis
3. **Develop constraint-adjustment framework** before proceeding

**Recommendation needed on next steps.**
