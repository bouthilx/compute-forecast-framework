# Compute Forecast Plan

## Project

Mila researchers require more compute resources in order to conduct their research. In order to request funding for more resources, we need to estimate the amount of RGU-years needed for our population of researchers up to 5 years from now.
 
Making an accurate forecast is difficult, we will thus rely on different sources of information to validate our estimations. Surveys will be sent to professors for predictions of future projects and to students for documentation of past projects. These results will then be cross-validated using statistics from an automated literature review and cluster usage data.

In parallel to these efforts, we will gather statistics about compute resources from other research institutions to provide comparisons. 

## Goals
1. Collect predictions of future projects from every core professors
    a. The predictions should involve all students supervised by these professors. 
    b. Any significant deviations (~20%) from past compute usage should be well supported by the project description.
2. Collect compute usage documentation from at least 10 papers per core professor. (if possible)
    a. The documented usage should be less than 20% off from the cluster usage analysis.
3. Document compute resources from other research institutions
    a. Metric TBD. 

## Surveys

The surveys will be designed by I+D and then sent to professors. The surveys will be sent in 4 iterations, one every 2 weeks, in order to distribute the workload evenly and to allow improving the surveys after each iteration. The 40 core professors will be randomly divided into 4 groups that will be assigned to the different iterations.

## Future projects

A survey link will be sent to the professors. The professors are expected to submit as many projects as they believe their group would undertake in the next year. They may redirect the survey to their students as they see fit, but they are accountable for their students to answer. I+D will verify whether the projects involve all the supervised students, otherwise they will follow up with the professor to ensure there are no underestimations.

## Past works

A list of papers will be sent to the professors along with a link to a survey. The professors are then responsible for sending the survey to one of the students involved and to ensure the proper submission of the survey by the student. I+D will verify whether the surveys are filled for every paper, otherwise they will follow up with the professor to ensure all papers are properly documented. When papers are documented, I+D will cross-validate the results with cluster usage data, otherwise they will follow up directly with the students to fix any issues in the documented results or misalignments between the documented results and cluster usage data.
