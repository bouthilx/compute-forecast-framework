# Measuring Suppressed Computational Demand: A Comprehensive Framework

## Executive Summary

Suppressed demand represents the gap between what researchers would ideally compute and what they actually compute due to constraints. This document provides actionable methods to measure this critical metric, which can provide compelling evidence for resource allocation decisions.

## 1. Direct Measurement Methods

### 1.1 Resource Request vs. Allocation Analysis
**Method**: Track compute resource requests versus actual allocations
```python
suppression_metrics = {
    "requested_gpu_hours": 125000,
    "allocated_gpu_hours": 45000,
    "suppression_ratio": 2.78,  # 64% of demand unmet
    "denied_requests": 234,
    "partial_fulfillments": 156
}
```

**Implementation**:
- Instrument job schedulers to log all requests
- Track both denied and downsized requests
- Measure queue wait times as proxy for overdemand

### 1.2 Explicit Constraint Documentation
**Method**: Systematic extraction from papers and code
```python
constraint_patterns = [
    "due to computational constraints",
    "limited by available compute",
    "restricted our experiments to",
    "would require prohibitive compute",
    "left for future work when resources permit",
    "smaller model due to resource limitations"
]
```

**Data Sources**:
- Paper text mining (methods/limitations sections)
- Code comments in repositories
- Grant proposals mentioning compute needs

### 1.3 Pre/Post Allocation Studies
**Method**: Compare research plans before and after resource allocation
```python
research_modification_tracking = {
    "original_plan": {
        "model_size": 70e9,
        "training_runs": 10,
        "ablation_studies": 15
    },
    "actual_execution": {
        "model_size": 7e9,  # 10x reduction
        "training_runs": 3,  # 70% reduction
        "ablation_studies": 2  # 87% reduction
    }
}
```

## 2. Indirect Indicators

### 2.1 Model Architecture Proxies

    "parameter_efficiency_focus": {
        "mila_papers": 0.78,  # 78% emphasize efficiency
        "unconstrained_baseline": 0.35,  # 35% in industry papers
        "indicator_strength": "strong"
    },
    "early_stopping_prevalence": {
        "mila_papers": 0.85,
        "benchmark_papers": 0.45,

    }
}
```

### 2.2 Hyperparameter Search Limitations
**Method**: Analyze hyperparameter optimization strategies
```python
hpo_constraints = {
    "grid_search_density": {
        "mila_average": 12,  # combinations tested

        "suppression_factor": 12.3
    },
    "manual_tuning_prevalence": {
        "mila": 0.65,  # 65% use manual/heuristic
        "benchmark": 0.15  # 15% in well-resourced labs
    }
}
```

### 2.3 Dataset Size Adaptations
**Method**: Compare dataset usage patterns
```python
dataset_constraints = {
    "full_dataset_usage": {
        "mila": 0.23,  # 23% use full datasets
        "benchmark": 0.89  # 89% in benchmark papers
    },

## Conclusion

Measuring suppressed demand provides crucial evidence that transforms resource requests from "wishlist" to "documented need." The multi-method approach ensures robust, defensible metrics that can withstand scrutiny while providing actionable insights for resource allocation.

The framework's strength lies in triangulating multiple indicators - when request data, paper evidence, and researcher surveys all point to 60-70% suppressed demand, the case becomes compelling and difficult to dismiss.
